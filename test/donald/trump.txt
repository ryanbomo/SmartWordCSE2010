1.1 Donald Trump 

For other uses, see Donald Trump (disambiguation). 

Donald John Trump (bom June 14, 1946) is an American 
businessman, television personality, and since June 2015, a 
candidate for the Republican nomination for President of 
the United States in the 2016 election. He is the chairman 
and president of The Trump Organization and the founder 
of Trump Entertainment Resorts. Trump’s career, branding 
efforts, personal life, wealth, and outspoken manner have 
made him a celebrity. 

Trump is a native of New York City and a son of Fred 
Trump, who inspired him to enter real estate development. 
While still attending college he worked for his father’s firm, 
Elizabeth Trump & Son. Upon graduating in 1968 he 
joined the company, and in 1971 was given control, renam- 
ing the company “The Trump Organization”. Since then he 
has built hotels, casinos, golf courses, and other properties, 
many of which bear his name. He is a major figure in the 
American business scene and has received prominent media 
exposure. The NBC reality show The Apprentice bolstered 
his fame, and his three marriages were extensively reported 
in tabloids. 

Trump first ran for President of the United States in 2000, 
winning two Reform Party primaries. On June 16, 2015, 
Trump announced his decision to run again for President, 
this time as a Republican, before winning the New Hamp- 
shire primary with 35%, 161 the South Carolina primary with 
33%, 171 and the Nevada caucus with 46% of the votes. 181 

1.1.1 Early life 

Donald John Trump was born on June 14, 1946, in Queens, 
a borough of New York City. 191110111111121 He is the fourth of 
five children to Mary Anne (nee MacLeod; 1912-2000), a 
homemaker and philanthropist 1131 and Fred Trump (1905- 
1999), who worked as a real estate developer. His mother 
was born at Tong on the Scottish island of Lewis. 1141 In 


1930, aged 18, she visited the United States and met Fred 
Trump. They were married in 1936 and settled in Jamaica 
Estates, Queens, and Fred Trump eventually became one 
of the city’s biggest real estate developers. 1131 1 151 Trump has 
one brother, Robert (born 1948), and two sisters: Maryanne 
(born 1937) and Elizabeth (born 1942). Maryanne is a 
United States federal judge on senior status for the United 
States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. 1161 Another 
brother, Fred Jr. (1938-1981), died of complications from 
alcoholism. 1171 

Trump’s paternal grandparents, Elizabeth (nee Christ) and 
Frederick Trump, were emigrants who moved to the United 
States from Germany in 1885. 1181 Frederick worked as a 
successful Klondike Gold Rush restaurateur and brothel 
keeper. 119112011211 In a 1976 New York Times biographical 
profile, 1221 and again in Trump’s 1987 book. The Art of 
the Deal, Donald Trump incorrectly stated that Frederick 
Trump was of Swedish origin, 12311241 an assertion that Fred 
Trump had made for many years. 1251 Trump later acknowl- 
edged his German ancestry and served as grand marshal of 
the 1999 German- American Steuben Parade in New York 
City. 1151 

The family had a two-story mock Tudor Revival home on 
Wareham Place in Jamaica Estates 1261 where Trump lived 
while attending The Kew-Forest School. At Kew-Forest, 
Fred Trump served as a member of the Board of Trustees. 
Due to behavior problems. Trump left the school at age 
13 and was enrolled in the New York Military Academy 
(NYMA). 1271 In 1983, Fred told an interviewer that Don- 
ald “was a pretty rough fellow when he was small”. Trump 
finished eighth grade and high school at NYMA. 1281 During 
his senior year. Trump participated in marching drills and 
wore a uniform, attaining the rank of captain. 1291 In 2015, 
he told a biographer that NYMA gave him “more training 
militarily than a lot of the guys that go into the military”. 1301 

Trump attended Fordham University in the Bronx for two 
years. He entered the Wharton School of Business at the 
University of Pennsylvania, as Wharton then offered one of 
the few real estate studies departments in U.S. academia. 131 1 
While there, he worked at his father’s company, Elizabeth

Trump & Son. 1321 Trump graduated from Wharton in 1968 
with a bachelor’s degree in economics.' 33 " 34 ' 

Trump was eligible for the draft lottery during the Vietnam 
War. 1351 “I actually got lucky because I had a very high 
draft number” he told WNYW in 201 1.' 36 ' Selective Ser- 
vice records retrieved by The Smoking Gun website from 
the National Archives show that, although Trump did even- 
tually receive a high selective service lottery number in 
1969, he was not drafted earlier secondary to four stu- 
dent deferments (2-S) while attending college, as well as 
a medical deferment (1-Y, later converted to 4-F) obtained 
in 1968 after his college graduation, prior to the lottery be- 
ing initiated. 1371 Trump was deemed fit for service after a 
military medical examination in 1966 and was briefly clas- 
sified as 1-A by a local draft board shortly before his 1968 
medical disqualification. 1381 Trump attributed his medical 
deferment to "heel spurs" in both feet, according to a 2015 
biographer, 1301 but told an Iowa campaign audience he suf- 
fered from a spur in one foot, although he could not remem- 
ber which one. 1381 


1.1.2 Business career 

When Trump graduated from college in 1968, he was worth 
about US$200,000 (equivalent to $1,021,000 in 2016). [391 
He began his career at his father’s real estate company, 1401 
Elizabeth Trump and Son, 1411 which focused on middle- 
class rental housing in the New York City boroughs of 
Brooklyn, Queens, and Staten Island. During his under- 
graduate study, one of Trump’s first projects was the revi- 
talization of the foreclosed Swifton Village apartment com- 
plex in Cincinnati, Ohio, which his father had purchased for 
$5.7 million in 1962.' 42 ' Fred and Donald Trump became 
involved in the project and, with a $500,000 investment, 
turned the 1,200-unit complex’s occupancy rate from 34% 
to 100%. Trump oversaw the company’s 14,000 apartments 
across Brooklyn, Queens, and Staten Island. 1431 In 1972, 
The Trump Organization sold Swifton Village for $6.75 
million.' 44 " 45 ' 

In 1971, Trump moved to Manhattan, where he became in- 
volved in larger construction projects, and used attractive 
architectural design to win public recognition. 146 ' Trump 
initially came to public attention in 1973 when he was ac- 
cused by the Justice Department of violations of the Fair 
Housing Act in the operation of 39 buildings. Trump in turn 
accused the Justice Department of targeting his company 
because it was a large one, and in order to force it to rent to 
welfare recipients. Trump settled the charges in 1975, say- 
ing he was satisfied that the agreement did not “compel the 
Trump organization to accept persons on welfare as tenants 
unless as qualified as any other tenant.”' 47 ' 

Trump had an option to buy and made plans to develop the

real estate around the world such as Trump International Hotel and 
Tower in Chicago, Illinois. 


Penn Central Transportation Company property, which was 
in bankruptcy. This included the 60th Street rail yard on 
the Hudson River — later developed as Riverside South — as 
well as the land around Grand Central Terminal, for which 
he paid $60 million with no money down. 148 ' Later, with 
the help of a 40-year tax abatement from the New York 
City government, he turned the bankrupt Commodore Ho- 
tel next to Grand Central into the Grand Hyatt' 49 ' and cre- 
ated The Trump Organization.' 50 ' 

Trump promoted Penn Central’s 30th Street rail yard as 
a site for New York City’s planned Jacob K. Javits Con- 
vention Center. Trump estimated his company could have 
completed the project for $110 million,' 51 ' but, while the 
city chose his site, it rejected his offer and Trump received 
a broker’s fee on the sale of the property instead. Repairs 
on the Wollman Rink in Central Park, built in 1955, were 
started in 1980 with an expected 2 V^-year construction 
schedule, but were not completed by 1986. Trump took 
over the management of the project without the city needing 
to pay anything, and completed it in three months for $ 1 .95 
million, which was $750,000 less than the initial budget.' 52 ' 

In 1988, Trump acquired the Taj Mahal Casino in a transac- 
tion with Merv Griffin and Resorts International,' 53 ' which

led to mounting debt, 1341 and by 1989, Trump was un- 
able to meet loan payments. Although he secured addi- 
tional loans and postponed interest payments, increasing 
debt brought Trump to business bankruptcy by 1991. 1541 
Banks and bondholders had lost hundreds of millions of 
dollars but opted to restructure the debt. The Taj Ma- 
hal emerged from bankruptcy on October 5, 1991, with 
Trump ceding 50 percent ownership in the casino to the 
original bondholders in exchange for lowered interest rates 
on the debt and more time to pay it off. 155 ' He also sold his 
financially challenged Trump Shuttle airline and his 282- 
foot megayacht, the Trump Princess , 1561 The late 1990s saw 
a resurgence in Trump’s financial situation. The will of 
Trump’s father, who died in 1999, divided an estate esti- 
mated at $250-300 million equally among his four surviv- 
ing children. 1251 

In 2001, Donald Trump completed Trump World Tower, a 
72-story residential tower across from the United Nations 
Headquarters. 1571 Also, he began construction on Trump 
Place, a multi-building development along the Hudson 
River. Trump owns commercial space in Trump Inter- 
national Hotel and Tower, a 44-story mixed-use (hotel 
and condominium) tower on Columbus Circle. Trump 
owns several million square feet of prime Manhattan real 
estate. 1581 

Trump has licensed his name and image for the develop- 
ment of many real estate projects. At least two Trump- 
branded real estate projects have gone into foreclosure. 1591 
The Turkish owner of Trump Towers Istanbul, who pays 
Trump for the use of his name, was reported in December 
2015 to be exploring legal means to dissociate the property 
after the candidate’s call to ban Muslims from entering the 
U.S. [60] 

An analysis of his business career by The Economist con- 
cludes that his "...performance has been mediocre com- 
pared with the stockmarket and property in New York.” 1611

Trump Tower 

Main article: Trump Tower (New York City) 

Trump Tower — a 58-story, mixed-use skyscraper at 725 
Fifth Avenue in Midtown Manhattan, New York City — 
was developed by Trump and the Equitable Life Assur- 
ance Company, and was designed by architect Der Scutt 
of Swanke Hayden Connell. 1621 It is today solely owned by 



Trump Tower, at 725 Fifth Avenue, in Midtown Manhattan 

Trump. 

Trump Tower occupies the former site of the architec- 
turally significant Bonwit Teller flagship store, demolished 
in 1980. 1631 1641 Trump courted controversy for destroy- 
ing valuable Art Deco bas-relief sculptures on its facade, 
promised to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, 16311641 and 
for a contractor’s use of some 200 undocumented Polish 
immigrant workers in the rushed demolition process, who 
were paid (if at all) just $4 and $5 per hour for work in 12- 
hour shifts. 16511661 Trump testified in 1990 he rarely visited 
the site and was unaware of the illegal workers, some of 
whom lived at the site and who were known as the “Polish 
Brigade”. A long-running labor lawsuit was settled in 1999, 
with its record sealed. 16511661 

Golf courses 

The Trump Organization operates many golf courses and 
resorts in the U.S. and around the world. 1671 On Febru- 
ary 11, 2014, it was announced that Trump had purchased 
Doonbeg Golf Club in the Republic of Ireland. It was con- 
firmed that the club would be renamed Trump International 
Golf Links, Ireland. 1681 

In 2006, Trump bought the Menie Estate in Balmedie, Ab- 
erdeenshire, Scotland, creating a highly controversial golf

resort, against the wishes of local residents, on an area 
designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest. 16911701 
You've Been Trumped is a 2011 independent documentary 
by British filmmaker Anthony Baxter that chronicles the 
golf resort’s construction and the subsequent struggles be- 
tween the locals and Donald Trump. 1711 Despite Trump’s 
promises of 6,000 jobs, by his own admission, a decade 
later, the Scotland golf course has created only 200 jobs. 1721 

In April 2014, Trump purchased the Turnberry hotel 
and golf resort in Ayrshire, Scotland, which is a regu- 
lar fixture in the Open Championship rota. 17311741 In June 
2015, Trump’s appeal objecting to an offshore windfarm 
(Aberdeen Bay Wind Farm) within sight of the golf links 
was denied. 1731 

In December 2015 Trump’s attempt to prevent the wind- 
farm being built within sight of his golf course was dis- 
missed by five justices at the UK Supreme Court in the case 
of Trump International Golf Club Scotland Ltd v The Scot- 
tish Ministers. Commenting on the decision, former Scottish 
First Minister Alex Salmond branded Trump “three times 
a loser”. A spokesman for The Trump Organization re- 
sponded to Salmond’s comment by saying: “Does anyone 
care what this man thinks? He’s a has-been and totally ir- 
relevant. The fact that he doesn't even know what’s going 
on in his own constituency says it all ... He should go back 
to doing what he does best: unveiling pompous portraits of 
himself that pander to his already over-inflated ego.” 1761

$450,000 per speech. 18 1 1 1921 1 93 l 1941 1 95 l 1961 1 97 l 

In 2011, Forbes' financial experts estimated the value of the 
Trump brand at $200 million. Trump disputes this valu- 
ation, saying that his brand is worth about $3 billion. 1981 
Many developers pay Trump to market their properties and 
to be the public face for their projects. 1991 For that reason. 
Trump does not own many of the buildings that display his 
name. 1 " 1 According to Forbes , this portion of Trump’s em- 
pire, actually run by his children, is by far his most valu- 
able, having a $562 million valuation. According to Forbes, 
there are 33 licensing projects under development includ- 
ing seven “condo hotels” (the seven Trump International 
Hotel and Tower developments). In June 2015, Forbes 
pegged the Trump brand at USD$125 million 11001 as re- 
tailers like Macy’s Inc. and Serta Mattresses began drop- 
ping Trump branded products, with Macy’s saying they are 
“disappointed and distressed by recent remarks about im- 
migrants from Mexico.” 1101111021

Net worth 


Unlike past Presidential candidates. Trump has never 
publicly verified his income claims by releasing his tax 
returns; 1 1031 “I try to pay as little tax as possible ... It’s a little 
tax”. Trump told an interviewer in January 2016, while say- 
ing he was preparing the documents for release in the near 
future and claiming to have filed “big returns”. 1 1041 Former 
GOP Presidential candidate Mitt Romney is among those 
who have questioned Trump’s purported wealth and his un- 
willingness to release his tax returns, suggesting Trump 
might be wary of revealing a potential electoral “bomb- 
shell” such as a failure to pay expected tax rates, dishonesty 
about charitable donations, or that “he’s not anywhere near 
as wealthy as he says he is”. [105] 1 106 1 [to 7 ] [ 108 ] j n t jj e wa ]j e 
of Romney’s accusation. Trump said during a February 25, 
2016 debate that he was currently subject to an IRS audit 
going back “two or three years”, 11091 later saying the au- 
dit affected “four or five” years, 19 101 and that he had been 
audited every year for the past 12 years. 11111 Trump later 
told CNN he suspected the government’s scrutiny was due 
to religion, because he was a “strong Christian”. 11121 As he 
was “in the midst of negotiating and talking with the IRS” 
over tax obligations going back several years, he would nei- 
ther reveal recent returns nor records for audited years he 
had “passed” because such records “mesh” and “interrelate” 
with current disputed IRS filings. 11121 Tax experts observed 
that the normal statute of limitations for IRS audits is three 
years, and an inquiry involving four or five years of returns 
might indicate substantial under-reporting or evidence of 
fraud, in which case normal statutes of limitations do not 
apply. 11101 

Trump was listed on the initial Forbes List in 1982 as hav- 
ing an estimated $200 million fortune, including a share of 
his father’s estimated $200 million net worth. 1 1 131 After sev- 
eral years on the list, Trump’s financial indiscipline in the 
1980s caused him to be dropped from 1990 to 1995, and 
reportedly obliged him to borrow from his siblings’ trusts in 
1993; 11131 in 2005, The New York Times referred to Trump’s 
“verbal billions” in a skeptical article about Trump’s self- 
reported wealth. 11 131 At the time, three individuals with di- 
rect knowledge of Trump’s finances told reporter Timothy 
L. O'Brien that Trump’s actual net worth was between $150 
and $250 million, though Trump then publicly claimed a net 
worth of $5 to $6 billion. 11131 Claiming libel. Trump sued 
the reporter (and his book publisher) for $5 billion, lost the 
case, and then lost again on appeal; Trump refused to turn 
over his unredacted tax returns despite his assertion they 
supported his case. 11141 In a sworn deposition. Trump tes- 
tified that he once borrowed $9.6 million from his father, 
calling it “a very small amount of money”, but could not 
recall when he did so; 11151 Trump has since told campaign 
audiences he began his career with “a small loan of one mil- 


lion dollars” from his father, 11151 which he paid back with 
interest: “it has not been easy for me”. Trump told one New 
Hampshire crowd. 11161 

In April 2011, amidst speculation whether Trump would 
run as a candidate in the U.S. presidential election of 2012, 
Politico quoted unnamed sources close to him stating that, 
if Trump should decide to run for president, he would file 
“financial disclosure statements that [would] show his net 
worth [was] in excess of $7 billion with more than $250 mil- 
lion of cash, and very little debt”. 11171 (Presidential candi- 
dates are expected to disclose their finances after announc- 
ing their intentions to run.) Although Trump did not run as 
a candidate in the 2012 elections, his “professionally pre- 
pared” 2012 financial disclosure was published in his book 
which claimed a $7 billion net worth. 1 1 181

Estimates of Trump’s net worth have fluctuated along with 
real estate valuations: in 2015, Forbes pegged it as $4 
billion, 1 " 91 while the Bloomberg Billionaires Index (which 
scrutinized Trump’s FEC filings) estimated a net worth of 
$2.9 billion. 11201 On June 16, 2015, just prior to announcing 
his candidacy for president of the United States, Trump re- 
leased to the media a one-page prepared financial disclosure 
statement “from a big accounting firm — one of the most 
respected” 11211 stating a net worth of $8,737,540,000. 11221 
“I'm really rich”, Trump said. 11211 Forbes called the nearly 
$9 billion figure a “100%" exaggeration. 11231 In June 2015, 
Business Insider published Trump’s June 2014 financial 
statement, noting that $3.3 billion of that total is repre- 
sented by “Real Estate Licensing Deals, Brand and Branded 
Developments”, described by Business Insider as “basi- 
cally [implying] that Trump values his character at $3.3 
billion”. 11241 In July 2015, the Federal election regulators 
released new details of Trump’s wealth and financial hold- 
ings when he became a Republican presidential candidate, 
reporting that his assets are worth above $1.4 billion, which 
includes at least $70 million in stocks, and a debt of at least 
$265 million. 1125111261 

Trump said in a July 2015 press release, one month after 
announcing his presidential run, that his “net worth is in

excess of TEN BILLION DOLLARS” (emphasis in origi- 
nal document). 1126111271 However, Trump has testified that 
“my net worth fluctuates, and it goes up and down with 
markets and with attitudes and with feelings — even my own 
feelings”. 1 1281 On the same day, Trump’s estimates of his net 
worth have varied by as much as $3.3 billion. 1 1 131 Trump has 
also acknowledged that past exaggerated estimates of his 
wealth have been “good for financing”. 11291 Forbes has said 
that although Trump “shares a lot of information with us 
that helps us get to the figures we publish”, he “consistently 
pushes for a higher net worth — especially when it comes 
to the value of his personal brand.” 11231 Forbes reduced its 
estimate of Trump’s net worth by $125 million following 
Trump’s controversial 2015 remarks about Mexican illegal 
immigrants, which ended Trump’s business contracts with 
NBCUniversal, Univision, Macy’s, Serta, PVH Corpora- 
tion, and Perfumania. 11301 An internal Young & Rubicam 
study of Trump’s brand favorability among high-income 
consumers showed “plummeting” ratings at the end of 2015, 
suggesting Trump’s various businesses could face market 
and financing challenges in the future. 11311 

Investments 

A portion of Trump’s fortune is held in assets outside his 
holdings in The Trump Organization, most of which are 
concentrated in the financial market. In 201 1, Trump made 
a rare foray into the stock market after being disappointed 
with the depressed American real estate market and facing 
poor returns on bank deposits. He stated that he was not a 
stock market person, but he also stated that prime real es- 
tate at good prices is hard to get. Among the stocks Trump 
purchased, he stated he bought stock in Bank of Amer- 
ica, Citigroup, Caterpillar Inc., Intel, Johnson & Johnson 
and Procter & Gamble. 11321 In December 2012, Trump re- 
vealed that he also added shares of Lacebook to his stock 
portfolio. 11331 Trump also has US$9 million invested in 
hedge funds. 11341 He earned US$6.7 million from selling 
shares in Bank of America and an additional US$3.9 mil- 
lion from selling Lacebook in 20 14. 11001 

Sports 

In 1983, Trump purchased the New Jersey Generals for 
the inaugural season of the United States Lootball League 
(USLL). The Generals hired former New York Jets head 
coach Walt Michaels. Prior to the inaugural season. Trump 
sold the franchise to Oklahoma oil magnate J. Walter Dun- 
can. Prior to the 1984 season, Duncan sold the team back 
to Trump. 11351 

The USLL planned to play its 1986 schedule in the fall, di- 
rectly opposite the National Lootball League (NLL), thanks 



Trump at a baseball game in 2009 

mostly to Trump’s strong advocacy of direct competition 
with the older, established league. Two years earlier. 
Trump sold most of his fellow owners on a move to the fall 
by arguing that it would eventually force a merger with the 
NLL — in which the owners of any USLL teams included in 
a merger would see their investment more than double. 11361 

The Generals merged with the Houston Gamblers during 
the extended offseason, adding such stars as quarterback 
Jim Kelly and wide receiver Ricky Sanders. Michaels was 
fired, replaced with former Gamblers coach Jack Pardee, 
who planned to bring the Gamblers’ high-powered run and 
shoot offense with him. However, the USLL’s “Dream 
Team” never took the field. The 1986 season was cancelled 
after the USLL won a minimal verdict in an antitrust lawsuit 
against the NLL; the league folded soon afterward. 

Trump at one time acted as a financial advisor for Mike 
Tyson, 11371 hosting Tyson’s fight against Michael Spinks in 
Atlantic City. 11381 

Beauty pageants 

Lurther information: Miss USA, Miss Universe and Miss 
Teen USA 

Prom 1996 until 2015, when he sold his interests to 
WME/IMG, 1 ' 391 Trump owned part or all of the Miss Uni- 
verse, Miss USA, and Miss Teen USA beauty pageants. 
Among the most recognized beauty pageants in the world, 
the Miss Universe pageant was founded in 1952 by the Cal- 
ifornia clothing company Pacific Mills. 

In 2015, NBC and Univision both ended their business 
relationships with the Miss Universe Organization after 
Trump’s presidential campaign kickoff speech on June 16, 
in which he stated: 

The U.S. has become a dumping ground for 
everybody else’s problems. [Applause] Thank

you. It’s true, and these are the best and the 
finest. When Mexico sends its people, they're 
not sending their best. They're not sending you. 
They're not sending you. They're sending people 
that have lots of problems, and they're bringing 
those problems with us. They're bringing drugs. 
They're bringing crime. They're rapists. And 
some, I assume, are good people”. 11401 

Trump subsequently filed a $500 million lawsuit against 
Univision, alleging a breach of contract and defamation. 
Cable network Reelz then acquired the rights to exclu- 
sively telecast the Miss USA pageant. 1141111421 Trump told 
People magazine in July 2015 that the lawsuit against Uni- 
vision was “part of the [presidential] campaign”. 11431 On 
September 11, 2015, Trump announced that he purchased 
NBC’s stake in the Miss Universe Organization, making 
him the sole owner, and had “settled” his lawsuits against the 
network, 11431 though it was not immediately clear whether 
Trump had filed lawsuits against NBC or merely threatened 
to do so. 11441 He sold his own interests in the pageant shortly 
afterwards. 11391 

1.1.4 Entertainment media 

In the media. Trump is a two-time Emmy Award- 
nominated personality and has made appearances as a car- 
icatured version of himself in television series and films

The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, Days of Our Lives, Wall 
Street: Money Never Sleeps 1145] ), and as a character (The 
Little Rascals ). He has been the subject of comedi-

annual pension of more than $1 10,000 every year. 1152111531 

The Apprentice 

Main article: The Apprentice (U.S. TV series) 

In 2003, Trump became the executive producer and host of 
the NBC reality show The Apprentice, in which a group of 
competitors battled for a high-level management job in one 
of Trump’s commercial enterprises. Contestants were suc- 
cessively “fired” and eliminated from the game. In 2004, 
Trump filed a trademark application for the catchphrase 
"You're fired.” 

For the first year of the show. Trump earned $50,000 
per episode (roughly $700,000 for the first season), but 
following the show’s initial success, he was paid a re- 



Trump posing with guest personality Dennis Rodman, during Rod- 
man’s 2009 participation on Celebrity Apprentice 


ported $3 million per episode, making him one of the 
highest paid TV personalities. In July 2015, Trump re- 
ported in his personal financial disclosure statement with 
the Federal Election Commission that NBCUniversal had 
paid him $213,606,575 for his 14 seasons of hosting 
the show. 1100111541 In 2007, Trump received a star on the 
Hollywood Walk of Fame for his contribution to television 
(The Apprentice ). 11551 

Along with British TV producer Mark Burnett, Trump 
was hired as host of The Celebrity Apprentice, in which 
well-known stars compete to win money for their charities. 
While Trump and Burnett co-produced the show. Trump 
stayed in the forefront, deciding winners and “firing” losers. 

On February 16, 2015, NBC announced that they would 
be renewing The Apprentice for a 15th season. 11561 Eleven 
days later. Trump stated that he was “not ready” to sign on 
for another season because of the possibility of a presiden- 
tial run. 11571 Despite this, on March 18, NBC announced 
they were going ahead with production. 11581 On June 29, 
after widespread negative reaction stemming from Trump’s 
campaign announcement speech, NBC released a statement 
saying, “Due to the recent derogatory statements by Donald 
Trump regarding immigrants, NBCUniversal is ending its 
business relationship with Mr. Trump”, apparently ending

Political affiliations 

A 201 1 report by the Center for Responsive Politics showed 
that over the previous two decades of U.S. elections, Don- 
ald Trump made contributions to campaigns of both Re- 
publican Party and Democratic Party candidates, with the 
top 10 recipients of his political contributions being six 
Democrats and four Republicans.' 168 ' After 2011, his cam- 
paign contributions were more favorable to Republicans

On social issues. Trump describes himself as pro-life 11781 
and would ban late-term abortions except in cases of 
rape, incest, or health. 11781 He is in favor of cutting 
federal funding for Planned Parenthood. 11791 Trump sup- 
ports the Second Amendment, is opposed to gun con- 
trol in general, 1178111801 and has a New York concealed 
carry permit. 1 1 8 1 1 He supports fixing the federal background 
check system so that criminal and mental health records are 
always put into the system. 11801 Trump opposes legalizing 
recreational marijuana but supports legalizing medical mar- 
ijuana, 11821 while being supportive of states’ rights. 11821 
Trump has stated that he supports traditional marriage. 11831 
Of the June 2015 Obergefell v. Hodges, the Supreme Court 
ruling legalizing same-sex marriage nationwide, he said: “I 
would have preferred states, you know, making the deci- 
sion and I let that be known. But they made the decision. 
[...] So, at a certain point you have to be realistic about 

it ”[178] [184] 

Regarding healthcare and education. Trump favors replac- 
ing the Affordable Care Act (commonly referred to as 
“Obamacare”) with a free-market plan and competition to 
lower costs, although he has also stated support for a single- 
payer system in the past. 11851 Trump favors getting rid of 
backlogs and waitlists which are the focus of the Veterans 
Health Administration scandal. In a statement, he said he 
believes that Veterans Affairs facilities need to be upgraded 
with recent technology, hire more veterans to treat other 
veterans, increase support of female veterans, and create 
satellite clinics within hospitals in rural areas. 11861 Trump 
has stated his support for school choice and local control 
for primary and secondary schools. 11871 He opposes the 
Common Core State Standards Initiative for primary and 
secondary schools, 1178111881 and has called Common Core 
“a disaster” that must be ended. 11891 

On economic issues. Trump identifies as a "free trader". 1 1901 
His campaign’s tax plan calls for reducing the corporate tax 
rate to 15% concurrent with the elimination of various loop- 
holes and deductions. 11911 Trump believes the minimum 
wage should not be raised because increasing it would hurt 
America’s economic competitiveness. 11921 

On the issue of immigration. Trump has emphasized U.S. 
border security. During his first town hall campaign meet- 
ing in Derry, New Hampshire Trump claimed that if he won 
the election, “Day 1 of my presidency, illegal immigrants 
are getting out and getting out fast.” 11931 Trump opposes 
birthright citizenship, arguing that it is not or should not 
be protected by the Fourteenth Amendment to the United 
States Constitution. 1194111951 On people already illegally in 
the United States, Trump has variously said they should all 
be deported, that all should be deported but some could re- 
turn, that only some should be deported, or that the decision 
should be made after the border has been strengthened. 11631 


Regarding the environment. Trump has said that “the EPA 
is an impediment to both growth and jobs”. Trump sup- 
ports increased fracking and has criticized sustainable wind 
power alternatives, stating that “windmills are destroying 
every country they touch” while producing “unreliable and 
terrible” energy. 11961 He has called global warming “a total 
hoax”. 11831 

On foreign policy. Trump has at various times said he fa- 
vored sending U.S. troops as well as opposed sending U.S. 
troops to defeat the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. 11631 
In a 2002 interview. Trump said he favored invading Iraq. 
On February 18, 2016, he said that by the time the invasion 
occurred, he had become an opponent. 1 1971 In 2008, Trump 
said that George W. Bush should have been impeached for 
the war. 11981 Trump has been critical of Pakistan, com- 
paring it to North Korea, describing it as “probably the 
most dangerous country” in the world, and claiming that 
Pakistan’s nuclear weapons posed a “serious problem.” He 
has advocated improving relations with India as a “check” 
to Pakistan. 11991 


Presidential leanings, 1988-2012 

See also: Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2000 
Trump floated the idea of running for president in 1988, 
2004, and 2012, and for Governor of New York in 2006 
and 2014, but did not enter those races. 1202112031 He was 
considered as a potential running mate for George H. W. 
Bush on the Republican Party’s 1988 presidential ticket but 
lost out to future Vice President Dan Quayle. There is dis- 
pute over whether Trump or the Bush camp made the initial 
pitch. 12041 In 1999, Trump filed an exploratory committee 
to seek the presidential nomination of the Reform Party in 
2000. 12051 12061 A July 1999 poll matching him against likely 
Republican nominee George W. Bush and likely Demo- 
cratic nominee A1 Gore showed Trump with seven percent 
support. 12071 Though he dropped out of the race due to party 
infighting. Trump still won the party’s California and Michi- 
gan primaries. 12081 12091 1 2 10 H 2 1 1 1 

Trump later said that his national profile changed: “What 
happened was I did The Apprentice and it became a tremen- 
dous success. Who would have thought this was going to 
happen?" he told interviewer Larry King in 2005. “There’s 
sort of nothing like having the big hot show on television”. 
Trump said. 12121 

As Trump publicly speculated about seeking the 2012 
Republican presidential nomination, a Wall Street Jour- 
nal / NBC News poll released in March 201 1 found Trump 
leading among potential contenders, one point ahead 
of former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney. 12131 A 
Newsweek poll conducted in February 2011 showed Trump 
within a few points of Barack Obama, with many voters

undecided in the November 2012 general election for pres- 
ident of the United States. 12141 A poll released in April 
201 1 by Public Policy Polling showed Trump having a nine- 
point lead in a potential contest for the Republican nomi- 
nation for president while he was still actively considering 
a run. 1215112161 His moves were interpreted by some media 
as possible promotional tools for his reality show The Ap- 
prenticed 217 H 218 1 1219 1 Qn May 16, 2011, Trump announced 
he would not run for president. 12171 Public Policy Polling 
described the events of May 2011 as “one of the quickest 
rises and falls in the history of presidential politics”. 12201 


Between presidential announcements, 2011-15 

In April 2011, Trump questioned President Barack 
Obama's proof of citizenship, 12211 alleging that “his grand- 
mother in Kenya said he was born in Kenya, and she was 
there and witnessed the birth _”l 222 l (Trump’s claim derived 
from a discredited transcript of a telephone interview with 
Obama’s grandmother, produced by a Pennsylvania pastor 
opposed to Obama’s election.) 12231 Trump also questioned 



Trump speaking at the 2015 Conservative Political Action Confer- 
ence (CPAC) in National Harbor, Maryland 


whether Obama had good enough grades to warrant en- 
try to Harvard Law School. 12241 Trump is said to have sent 
a team of private investigators to Hawaii, Obama’s docu- 
mented birthplace, 12231 and told The Today Show “they can- 
not believe what they're finding.” 12251 On April 25, 2011, 
Trump called for Obama to end the citizenship issue by re- 
leasing the long form of his birth certificate. 122611227 ' Two 
days later, Obama made a formal statement in efforts by the 
White House to put the matter to rest with the release of the 
long form. 12281 Trump expressed pride at his role in the cer- 
tificate’s release in a press conference follow-up, saying he 
hoped it “checks out” and “we have to see, is it real?" 12291 
When asked in July 2015 whether Obama was born in the 
U.S., Trump said: “I really don't know. I mean, I don't 
know why he wouldn't release his records.” 1230112311 

In December 2008, Trump emerged as an early supporter of 
the 2009 government-backed rescue plan for the U.S. auto 
industry, which by 2012 was supported by 56% of Amer- 
icans (63% support in Michigan), according to a Pew Re- 
search Center poll. 1232112331 Statements of Trump’s hinting 
that vaccination would cause autism were subject to criti- 
cism in various media by the scientific community. 1234 " 2351 
He has also been criticized for climate change-denying 
statements, because they are discordant with the opinion of 
the scientific community. 12 ’ 61 

In 2013, Trump was a featured speaker at the Conservative 
Political Action Conference (CPAC). 12371 The speech was 
not well attended. 12381 He spent over $1 million to research 
a possible run for president of the United States. 12391 In Oc- 
tober 2013, New York Republicans had circulated a memo 
suggesting Trump should run for governor of the state in 

2014, against Andrew Cuomo. Trump said that while New 
York had problems and taxes were too high, running for 
governor was not of great interest to him. 12401 In February 

2015, Trump opted not to renew his television contract for 
The Apprentice, generating speculation that he might run for

Donald Trump announced his candidacy for President of 



Trump in Manchester, New Hampshire, February 2016 

the United States in the 2016 election at the Trump Tower 
in New York City with the slogan “Make America Great 
Again!" in June 2015. 

Trump has gained widespread support for the idea that 
he and his supporters call “telling it like it is”, 12421 with 
a significant disdain for political correctness. 12431 He is 
running counter to the Republican establishment, which 
widely opposes his candidacy and worries that him winning 
could hand the election to the Democratic nominee. 12441 
However, Trump’s candidacy has largely succeeded, partly 
because of widespread media coverage. 1245112461 He has 
frequently made bold and controversial statements on is- 
sues that largely appeal to working-class voters. 12471 Politi- 
cal opponents have described Trump as “divisive”, 1252112531 
“unserious”, 12541 and a “bully”. 12551 

Trump has made a number of high-profile personal at- 
tacks on journalists, 12561 politicians, 12571 and competing 
candidates. 12581 He often launches rapid, multiple-tweet 
Twitter rants against people who attack him or with 
whom he simply disagrees. 125911260112611 A comprehensive 
"encyclopedia" of Trump’s tweeted “insults” was published 
in the New York Times . 12621 

Eschewing the super PAC model popular among compet- 
ing candidates. Trump has urged that the ability to self- 
finance his campaign — backed by considerable personal 
wealth (due to him being a billionaire) — is proof that he 
“can't be bought”. 12631 However, as of October 15 donations 
outpaced self-financing; 12641 Trump spends much less than 
competing candidates, relying on free media coverage in- 
stead of paid television advertisements. 12651

estimated approximately 11 million illegal immigrants in 
the U.S., and the erection of a substantial wall on the 
Mexico-United States border. 1193112661 Felipe Calderon, 
former Mexican president said, “We are not going to pay 
any single cent for such a stupid wall! And it’s going to be 
completely useless.” 12671 

Trump has called for aggressive bombing of the Mideast 
terrorist group ISIS, and has supported surveillance of 
mosques in the U.S. 12681 Trump also caused outrage when 
he endorsed shooting Muslim terrorists with pig’s blood- 
dipped bullets in order to deter them, citing the alleged ex- 
ample set by U.S. general John J. Pershing during the Moro 
Rebellion. His comments were strongly denounced by the 
Council on American-Islamic Relations. 12691127011271112721 

Trump has employed strong rhetoric on religion. He has 
called for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United 
States, citing links between Muslims and terrorism. He has 
also raised questions about the general religious beliefs of 
other candidates, mainly Christianity, including Ben Carson 
and Ted Cruz. 12731

Other issues he highlights include taking care of military 
veterans, 12741 making the military “strong”, 12751 and getting 
trade agreements more favorable to American workers. 12761 

Trump is endorsed by Republican Governors Chris Christie 
(New Jersey), Paul LePage (Maine) and Republican Rep- 
resentatives Chris Collins (New York), Duncan D. Hunter 
(California). 12771 


Proposed ban on Muslims entering the U.S. In re- 
sponse to recent radical Islamic terrorist attacks. Trump 
proposed “a total and complete shutdown of Muslims en- 
tering the United States until our country’s representa- 
tives can figure out what ... is going on.” The proposal 
drew wide criticism from sources both within the U.S. and 
abroad-including unusual sources such as foreign leaders 
who are seldom involved in United States presidential cam- 
paigns, and leaders of Trump’s own party holding posi- 
tions that are rarely at odds during the party’s presiden- 
tial primaries. 1282112831 Critics included British Prime Min- 
ister David Cameron, 12821 French Prime Minister Manuel 
Vails, 12841 Saudi Prince Al-Waleed bin Talal 12851 and 
Canadian Foreign Minister Stephane Dion, 12861 as well as 
the chairman of the Republican Party Reince Priebus, Re- 
publican House Speaker Paul Ryan, and Republican Sen- 
ate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. 1283112871 A peti- 
tion to block Trump from entry into the United King- 
dom has gained over 540,000 signatures, a record for the 
UK Government website. 12881 Members of Trump’s own 
party argued that a proposal banning members of a ma- 
jor world religion violated the party’s conservative values, 
the Constitution's First Amendment (which grants freedom 
of religion), and the country’s immigrant heritage. Critics 
pointed out that the proposal would result in the exclusion 
of many of the most important allies in the country’s war on 
terror, from interpreters helping the CIA to Jordan’s King 
Abdullah, and that it would bolster ISIL by furthering its 
narrative that the U.S. is pitted against the Muslim faith. 
The U.S. Pentagon issued a statement that “anything that 
bolsters ISIL’s narrative and pits the United States against 
the Muslim faith is certainly not only contrary to our values 
but contrary to our national security.” 12891 The Washington 
Post reported that, “Donald Trump [was] featured in new 
jihadist recruitment video.” 12901 


across the political spectrum, signed a petition urging Ne- 
tanyahu not to meet with Trump later that month; 12971 a day 
later. Trump postponed his visit to Israel until “a later date 
after I become President of the U.S.”, 12981 stating that he 
did not want to put Netanyahu “under pressure”. 12961 

During a Fox News debate, when asked about the feasibility 
of his plan to bar Muslims from entering the United States 
(approximately 100,000 Muslim immigrants are admitted 
to the U.S. each year), 12991 Trump said that Belgium and 
France had been blighted by the failure of Muslims in these 
countries to integrate. Trump said that living in Brussels 
was like living in a “hellhole” because of its dire state in 
Muslim assimilation. 1300113011 


Petition to ban from the United Kingdom Following 
Trump’s controversial comments on Muslim immigration, 
a petition with the title “Block Donald J Trump from UK 
entry” 13021 was opened in the United Kingdom on the UK 
Parliament’s e-petition website, calling on the UK Home 
Office to ban him from entering the country. By 5:00am 
on December 11, the total number of signatures exceeded 
500,000, 13031 far above the threshold of 100,000 required to 
trigger a parliamentary debate. 13041 

On January 18, the House of Commons held a de- 
bate on whether to ban Trump in the Westminster Hall 
chamber, 13051 although the debate concluded without a vote 
as such a decision is reserved to the Home Secretary. 13061 
The three-hour long debate saw MPs from all political par- 
ties describe Trump as “crazy” and “offensive”. 13071 

1.1.6 Personal life 



In January 2013, Trump had been a popular figure in 
Israel, 1291112921 who has himself owned land in Israel. 12931 
Trump released a video endorsing Israeli Prime Minis- 
ter Benjamin Netanyahu during the 2013 Israeli elec- 
tions. 1294112951 However, after Trump’s December 2015 call 
to temporarily exclude Muslims from travel to the United 
States, numerous leaders, including Netanyahu, 12961 crit- 
icized Trump’s proposal. Several dozen Israeli Knesset 
members, many of whom are Muslim themselves, from

Trump has had three marriages, which have been well doc- 
umented in the tabloid media. 13081 His personal life has 
gained extensive media coverage. 13091 

Trump married Czech model Ivana Zelnickova on April 7, 
1977, at the Marble Collegiate Church in New York. 13101

Trump’s second-oldest son Eric (serves as executive vice president 
of The Trump Organization ) 


They have three children: sons Donald, Jr. (born Decem- 
ber 31, 1977) and Eric (born January 6, 1984), and daugh- 
ter Ivanka (born October 30, 1981). Ivana became a nat- 
uralized U.S. citizen in 1988, with Trump at her side. 13111 
Trump is popularly known as “The Donald”, a nickname 
perpetuated by the media after Ivana referred to him as 
such in a 1989 Spy Magazine cover story. 1312113131 By early 
1990, Trump’s troubled marriage to Ivana and long-running 
affair with actress Marla Maples had become widely docu- 
mented in the tabloid press. 124113141 The couple divorced in 
1991 [3i5] 

Maples gave birth to their daughter Tiffany on October 13, 
1993. They married two months later on December 20, 
1993. [3161 The couple formally separated in May 1997, |3I?I 
with their divorce finalized in June 1999. [318,,319! 

Trump dated model Kara Young in the mid to late 
1990s, 1320 and reportedly “bombarded” Princess Diana 
with expensive floral arrangements after her 1996 divorce 
from Prince Charles. [321] “I only have one regret in the 
women department - that I never had the opportunity to 
court Lady Diana Spencer”, Trump wrote in his 1997 book. 
The Art of the Comeback. “I met her on a number of occa- 
sions . . . She was a genuine princess - a dream lady.” 13221 
According to his former construction executive Barbara 
Res, Trump, using a pseudonym, leaked to the media a ru- 
mor that Diana was seeking to buy an apartment in Trump 
Tower, knowing Buckingham Palace would issue only a “no 
comment” statement. “He was brilliant at stuff like that”. 
Res said. 13231 In an interview three years after her death, 
Trump said he would have slept with Diana “without hesi- 


tation” and that “she had the height, she had the beauty, she 
had the skin”, while adding that “she was crazy, but these 
are minor details”. [324] 



Trump’s wife Melania , in 2011 


In 1998, Trump began a relationship with Slovenian- 
born fashion model, Melania Knauss. 1325,1326 They be- 
came engaged in April 20 04 13271 and were married on Jan- 
uary 22, 2005 at Bethesda-by-the-Sea Episcopal Church, 
on the island of Palm Beach, Florida, followed by a 
reception at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate. 132X1,3291 13301 In 
2006, Melania became a naturalized U.S. citizen. 13261 In 
March 2006, she gave birth to their son named Barron 
William Trump. 1 131,13321 (Trump had previously used the 
pseudonym “John Baron” in some business deals and when 
communicating with journalists. ,22,,65,[323] ) Having spo- 
ken the language since his childhood, Barron is fluent in 
Slovenian. |333] In a February 2009 interview on ABC’s news 
program Nightline, Trump commented on his ex-wives: “I 
just know it’s very hard for them [Ivana and Marla] to com- 
pete because I do love what I do. I really love it.” [3341 

Trump has seven grandchildren, and one on the way: 
five from his son Donald Jr. (Kai Madison, Donald 
John III, Tristan Milos, Spencer Frederick, and Chloe 
Sophia) 13351 ,336,,337 l and two from his daughter Ivanka (Ara-

Religious views 

Trump is a Presbyterian. 13401 In an April 2011 interview on 
the 700 Club, he commented: “I'm a Protestant, I'm a Pres- 
byterian. And you know I've had a good relationship with 
the church over the years. I think religion is a wonderful 
thing. I think my religion is a wonderful religion.” 1341113421 
Trump told a 2015 South Carolina campaign audience he 
joined the Marble Collegiate Church, where he married his 
first wife Ivana in 1977. The church has said he is “not an 
active member”. 13431 

In 1983, the Reverend Norman Vincent Peale, described 
in a New York Times profile as Trump’s “pastor” and “fam- 
ily minister”, said that Trump was “kindly and courteous in 
certain business negotiations and has a profound streak of 
honest humility.” 1281 Trump calls his own book The Art of 
the Deal (1987) “my second favorite book of all time”, and 
has told campaign audiences: “Do you know what my first 
is? The Bible! Nothing beats the Bible.” 1344113451 Declining 
to name his favorite Bible verse. Trump said “I don't like 
giving that out to people that you hardly know.” 13431 

Trump has said that, while he participates in Holy Commu- 
nion, he has not asked God for forgiveness for his sins. He 
says: “I think if I do something wrong, I think, I just try and 
make it right. I don't bring God into that picture.” 13461 

Trump has praised and maintains relationships with several 
prominent national evangelical and Christian leaders, in- 
cluding Tony Perkins and Ralph Reed. 13471 During his 2016 
presidential campaign, he received a blessing from Greek 
Orthodox priest Emmanuel Lemelson. 13481 

Pope Francis, however, claimed that Trump’s views on im- 
migration are contrary to Christian teachings: 13491 “A per- 
son who thinks only about building walls, wherever they 
may be, and not about building bridges, is not a true Chris- 
tian. This is not in the Gospel”, the Pope replied to a re- 
porter’s questions about Trump, adding “we must see if he 
said things in that way and in this I give the benefit of the 
doubt.” 13501 Trump called the Pope’s criticism “disgraceful” 
and suggested the Mexican government was “using the Pope 
as a pawn” for political purposes, 13511 “because they want to 
continue to rip off the United States”. 13521 Trump said that 
“if and when” ISIS attacks the Vatican, the Pope would have 
“wished and prayed” Trump were President because such an 
attack would not have happened. 13521 

Trump also has ties to the Jewish American community. 13531 
Asked in 2015 at an Algemeiner Journal awards ceremony 
honoring him with the Algemeiner Liberty Award, about 
having Jewish grandchildren. Trump said: “Not only do 
I have Jewish grandchildren, I have a Jewish daughter 


(Ivanka, who converted to Judaism before her marriage to 
Jared Kushner) and I am very honored by that ... it wasn't 
in the plan but I am very glad it happened.” 13541 

1.1.7 In popular culture 

In March 2011, Trump was the subject of a Comedy Cen- 
tral Roast. The special was hosted by Seth MacFarlane, and 
roasters included Larry King, Snoop Dogg, and Anthony 
Jeselnik among regular roast participants. Trump’s daugh- 
ter Ivanka was seen in the audience. 13551 In April 2011, 
Trump attended the White House Correspondents’ Dinner, 
featuring comedian Seth Meyers. President Obama used 
the occasion to present several prepared jokes mocking 
Trump. 13561 

You've Been Trumped, an award-winning 2011 documen- 
tary film by Anthony Baxter, follows the development of 
a Scottish golf resort. 1357113581 It shows Trump speaking lo- 
cally about his ambitions for the project, insulting a local 
farmer, who he claims lives in “a slum”, and being awarded 
an honorary degree by The Robert Gordon University, in 
spite of a professor at that university returning his own hon- 
orary degree in protest. 1359113601 It also queries the supposed 
economic benefits and examines the ecological impact and 
the effect on local residents. 18611361 1 When it was announced 
that the documentary was to be given its UK television 
premiere on BBC Two on October 21, 2012, 13621 Trump’s 
lawyers contacted the BBC to demand that the film should 
not be shown, claiming it was defamatory and misleading. 
The screening went ahead, the BBC defending the decision 
and stating that Trump had refused the opportunity to take 
part in the film. 13631 

On August 5, 2015, Trump: What's the Deal?, a 1991 doc- 
umentary by Libby Handros about Trump in the 1980s and 
1990s became available online. 13641 

1.1.8 Legal affairs 

Corporate bankruptcies 

Lour of Trump’s businesses have declared Chapter 11 
bankruptcy. 1365113661 According to a report by Forbes in 
2011, these were the result of over-leveraged hotel and 
casino businesses in Atlantic City: Trump’s Taj Mahal 
(1991), Trump Plaza Hotel (1992), Trump Hotels and 
Casino Resorts (2004), and Trump Entertainment Resorts 
(20 09). 1367113681 Trump said “I've used the laws of this coun- 
try to pare debt. . . . We'll have the company. We'll throw it 
into a chapter. We'll negotiate with the banks. We'll make 
a fantastic deal. You know, it’s like on The Apprentice. It’s 
not personal. It’s just business.” 13691 He indicated that other 
“great entrepreneurs” do the same. 13671 


1.1. DONALD TRUMP

The first Trump corporate entity to file bankruptcy was the Trump 
Taj Mahal in 1991. 


The first of Trump’s corporate entities to file bankruptcy 
was in 1991, when Trump Taj Mahal was unable to pay its 
obligations. 1 ’ 6 '-' 1 Forbes indicated that this first bankruptcy 
was the only one where Trump’s personal financial re- 
sources were involved. Time, however, maintains that $72 
million of his personal money was also involved in a later 
2004 bankruptcy. 13701 

On November 2, 1992, the Trump Plaza Hotel filed a 
prepackaged Chapter 1 1 protection plan. Under the plan. 
Trump agreed to give up a 49 percent stake in the lux- 
ury hotel to Citibank and five other lenders. 13711 In return 
Trump would receive more favorable terms on the remain- 
ing $550+ million owed to the lenders, and retain his po- 
sition as chief executive, though he would not be paid and 
would not have a role in day-to-day operations. 13721 

In the subsequent restructuring of these two events. Trump 
had eliminated a large portion of his $900 million per- 
sonal debt by 1994, 13731 and reduced significantly his nearly 
$3.5 billion in business debt. While he relinquished the 
Trump Princess yacht and the Trump Shuttle (which he had 
bought in 1989), he managed to retain Trump Tower in New 
York City and control of his three casinos in Atlantic City. 
Trump sold his ownership of West Side Yards to Asian de- 
velopers as a result of his negotiations with Chase Man- 
hattan Bank. Trump was reportedly paid a premium for 
placing his well-known moniker on the buildings that even- 
tually arose. In 1995, he combined his casino holdings into 
the publicly held Trump Hotels & Casino Resorts. The real 
estate assets became a source of wealth even when profits 
had struggled. 13741 

The third corporate bankruptcy was on October 2 1 , 2004, 
when Trump Hotels & Casino Resorts announced a restruc- 
turing of its debt. 1373 The plan called for Trump’s individ- 
ual ownership to be reduced from 56 percent to 27 percent, 


with bondholders receiving stock in exchange for surren- 
dering part of the debt. Trump Hotels was forced to seek 
voluntary bankruptcy protection to stay afloat. After the 
company applied for Chapter 1 1 Protection in November 
2004, Trump opted to relinquish his CEO position but re- 
tained a role as Chairman of the board. In May 20 05 13761 
the company emerged from bankruptcy as Trump Enter- 
tainment Resorts Holdings. 13771 Writing about this and pre- 
vious bankruptcies in his 2007 book. Think BIG and Kick 
Ass in Business and Life, Trump wrote: “I figured it was the 
bank’s problem, not mine. What the hell did I care? I actu- 
ally told one bank, 'I told you you shouldn't have loaned me 
that money. I told you the goddamn deal was no good." 43781 

Trump’s most recent corporate bankruptcy occurred in 
2009. On February 13, Trump announced that he would 
resign from the board of Trump Entertainment Resorts 
and four days later the company filed for Chapter 11 
bankruptcy. 13791 At that time. Trump Entertainment Resorts 
had three properties in Atlantic City: Trump Taj Mahal, 
Trump Plaza, and Trump Marina (sold in 2011). In early 
August 2014, Trump filed a lawsuit requesting his name be 
removed from the Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino and the 
Taj Mahal facilities since he no longer runs or controls the 
company. 13801 Trump Entertainment Resorts filed again for 
bankruptcy in 2014. 13811 

Lawsuits 

Over the course of his career, Trump has initiated and 
been the target of hundreds of lawsuits. 13821 His lawyer Alan 
Garten said in 2015 that this was “a natural part of doing 
business in this country”. 13831 

In 1973, the Justice Department filed suit against the Trump 
Management Corporation for alleged racial discrimination, 
which Trump’s company disputed. 13841 The case was settled 
out of court in 1975. 13851 

In 1990, after an analyst at Janney Montgomery Scott 
said that Trump’s Taj Mahal project would initially “break 
records” but would fail before the end of that year. Trump 
threatened to sue the firm unless the analyst recanted or was 
fired. The analyst refused to retract the statements, and was 
fired by his firm. 1 ’ 861 Taj Mahal declared bankruptcy for the 
first time in November 1990. 13871 A defamation lawsuit by 
the analyst against Trump for $2 million was settled out of 
court. 13881 The analyst’s statements regarding the Taj Ma- 
hal’s prospects were later called “stunningly accurate”. 13891 

In 2002, the Securities and Exchange Commission brought 
a financial-reporting case against Trump Hotels & Casino 
Resorts Inc., alleging that the company had committed sev- 
eral “misleading statements in the company’s third-quarter 
1999 earnings release”. The matter was settled with the de- 
fendant neither admitting nor denying the charge. 13901

During the 2008 financial crisis. Trump International Hotel 
and Tower in Chicago was unable to sell sufficient units. 
Lender Deutsche Bank refused to let Trump lower the 
prices on the units to spur sales. Arguing that the finan- 
cial crisis and resulting drop in the real estate market is 
due to circumstances beyond his control. Trump invoked 
a clause in the contract to not pay the loan. 1391 ' Trump then 
initiated a suit asserting that his image had been damaged. 
Both parties agreed to drop their suits, and sales of the units 
continued.' 392 ' 

In 2008, Trump filed a $100 million lawsuit for alleged 
fraud and civil rights violations' 393 ' against the California 
city of Rancho Palos Verdes, a seaside town of 41,000 with 
an annual budget just under $20 million, over thwarted 
luxury home development and expansion plans on part 
of a landslide-prone golf course purchased by Trump in 
2002 for $27 million.' 393 ' Trump had previously sued a 
local school district over land leased from them in the 
re-branded Trump National Golf Club, and had further 
angered some local residents by renaming a thorough- 
fare after himself.' 3931 Trump’s lawyer was unable to con- 
vince a judge that the city’s “relentless anti-growth mu- 
nicipal ideology”' 3941 had stymied Trump’s ambitions, as 
Trump had never submitted permit applications in the 
first place,' 394 ' and the suit was ultimately withdrawn in 
2012 with Trump and the city agreeing to modified ge- 
ological surveys and permit extensions for some 20 pro- 
posed luxury homes (in addition to 36 homes previously 
approved).' 394 " 395 ' Trump ultimately opted for a permanent 
conservation easement instead of expanded housing devel- 
opment on the course’s driving range.' 396 ' 

In 2009, Trump was sued by investors who had made de- 
posits, typically $200,000-$300,000 per person, for con- 
dos in the failed Trump Ocean Resort Baja Mexico.' 397 ' 
The investors alleged that Trump (whose videos promot- 
ing the development had been shown to potential investors) 
misrepresented his role in the project, stating after its fail- 
ure that he had been little more than a spokesperson for 
the entire venture, disavowing any financial responsibil- 
ity for the debacle.' 398 ' Investors were abruptly informed 
that they would be getting nothing back: “All that re- 
mains of Trump Baja is a highway billboard with a large 
photo of Donald Trump that advertises condos for sale. It 
hovers over a closed sales center and showroom, a paved 
parking lot, a big hole that cuts a wide swath, drainage 
pipes and construction equipment”, reported the Associated 
Press in 2009. ' 397 ' In the litigation that ensued in a Cal- 
ifornia court, Trump’s attorneys sought to question a San 
Diego Union-Tribune reporter about a 2006 story with the 
headline “Trump puts 'brand' on Baja with condo-hotel”, 
which quoted Trump saying he was a “significant” equity 
investor in the development.' 399 ' The California court re- 
jected Trump’s legal maneuver, siding with attorneys who 


argued that California Shield Law prevented discovery of 
a reporter’s unpublished notes.' 400 ' In 2013, Trump settled 
the lawsuit with more than one hundred would-be condo 
owners for an undisclosed amount.' 401 ' 

In 2011, an appellate court upheld a New Jersey Supe- 
rior Court judge’s decision dismissing Trump’s $5 billion 
defamation lawsuit against author Timothy L. O'Brien, who 
had reported in his book, TrwnpNation: The Art of Being 
The Donald (2006), that Trump’s true net worth was in fact 
between $150 and $250 million. Trump had reportedly told 
O'Brien he was worth billions and, in 2005, had publicly 
stated that he was worth billions.' 402 ' Trump complained 
that the author’s alleged underestimation of his net worth 
was motivated by malice and had cost him business deals 
and reputational damage.' 403 ' The appellate court, how- 
ever, noted the consistency of O'Brien’s three confidential 
sources.' 404 ' 

Trump sued comedian Bill Maher for $5 million in 2013. 
Maher had appeared on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno 
and had offered to pay $5 million to a charity if Trump 
produced his birth certificate to prove that Trump’s mother 
had not mated with an orangutan. This was in reciprocation 
for Trump having previously challenged Obama to produce 
his birth certificate. Trump had offered $5 million payable 
to a charity of Obama’s choice, if Obama produced his col- 
lege applications, transcripts, and passport records.' 405 " 406 ' 
Trump produced his birth certificate and filed a lawsuit af- 
ter Maher was not forthcoming, claiming that Maher’s $5 
million offer was legally binding. “I don't think he was 
joking,” Trump said. “He said it with venom.”' 405 ' Ma- 
her replied that Trump needed to learn the difference be- 
tween “what a joke is and what a contract is” and that the 
U.S. legal system is “not a toy for rich idiots to play with”, 
and said that it was obvious humans and orangutans can- 
not reproduce.' 407 ' Trump withdrew his lawsuit against the 
comedian after eight weeks.' 408 ' 

In 2013, in a lawsuit filed by New York Attorney Gen- 
eral Eric Schneiderman, Trump was accused of defraud- 
ing more than 5,000 people of $40 million for the oppor- 
tunity to learn Trump’s real estate investment techniques in 
a for-profit training program. Trump University, which op- 
erated from 2005 to 2011. ' 409 " 410 " 411 ' Schneiderman con- 
tended that Trump’s seminars constituted an “unlicensed, 
illegal educational institution” which utilized false adver- 
tising, bait-and-switch tactics, intentional misrepresenta- 
tion and other fraudulent practices.' 383 ' In January 2014, 
a New York Superior Court upheld part of the Attorney 
General’s case against Trump,' 412 ' and in October 2014, 
found Trump liable for not obtaining a license to operate 
the for-profit investment school, Trump Entrepreneur Ini- 
tiative, formerly known as Trump University. (Trump ul- 
timately stopped using the term “University” following a 
2010 order from New York regulators, who called Trump’s

use of the word “misleading and even illegal" ; the state had 
previously warned Trump in 2005 to drop the term or not 
offer seminars within New York.) 141311414114151 In a separate 
class action civil suit in mid-February 2014, a San Diego 
federal judge allowed claimants in California, Florida, and 
New York to proceed. 14161 A Trump counterclaim, alleg- 
ing that the state Attorney General’s investigation was ac- 
companied by a campaign donation shakedown, was inves- 
tigated by a New York ethics board and dismissed in Au- 
gust 2015. 14171 Trump also filed a $1 million defamation suit 
against former Trump University student Tarla Makaeff, 
who had spent about $37,000 on seminars, after she joined 
the class action lawsuit and publicized her classroom expe- 
riences on social media. 1398 ' Unable to prove malice. Trump 
University lost an anti-SLAPP lawsuit (under statutes de- 
signed to thwart legal intimidation of class action partici- 
pants) and was ordered by a U.S. District Judge in April 
2015 to pay Makaeff and her lawyers $798,774.24 in legal 
fees and costs.' 418 ' “That just shows you how low they will 
go to silence people”, Makaeff said.' 398 ' 

In 2014, the former Miss Pennsylvania Sheena Monnin ul- 
timately settled a $5 million arbitration judgment against 
her, having been sued by Trump after alleging that the Miss 
USA 2012 pageant results were rigged. Monnin wrote on 
her Facebook page that another contestant told her during 
a rehearsal that she had seen a list of the top five finalists, 
and when those names were called in their precise order, 
Monnin realized the pageant election process was suspect, 
compelling Monnin to resign her Miss Pennsylvania title. 
Trump’s lawyer said that Monnin’s allegations had cost the 
pageant a lucrative British Petroleum sponsorship deal and 
threatened to discourage women from entering Miss USA 
contests in the future. 14191 According to Monnin, testimony 
from the Miss Universe Organization and Ernst & Young 
revealed that the top 15 finalists were selected by pageant 
directors regardless of preliminary judges’ scores.' 420 ' As 
part of the settlement, Monnin was not required to retract 
her original statements.' 419 ' “Standing on truth has cost me 
much”, Monnin said.' 4211 

In 2014, the model Alexia Palmer filed a civil suit against 
Trump Model Management for promising a $75,000 an- 
nual salary but paying only $3,380.75 for three years’ work. 
Palmer claimed to be owed more than $200,000. Palmer 
contended that Trump Model Management charged, in 
addition to a management fee, “obscure expenses” from 
postage to limousine rides that consumed the remainder of 
her compensation. Trump attorney Alan Garten claims the 
lawsuit is “bogus and completely frivolous”.' 422 " 423 ' 

In 2015, Trump initiated a $100 million lawsuit against 
Palm Beach County claiming that officials, in a “deliberate 
and malicious” act, pressured the FA A to direct air traf- 
fic to the Palm Beach International Airport over his Mar- 
a-Lago estate. 1424 ' The air traffic is allegedly damaging the 


construction of the building and disrupting its ambience. 
Trump had previously sued twice over airport noise.' 424 ' 

In July 2015, Trump filed a $10 million lawsuit against chef 
Jose Andres claiming that he backed out of a deal to open 
the flagship restaurant at Trump International Hotel Wash- 
ington, D.C.' 425 ' Andres replied that Trump’s lawsuit was 
“both unsurprising and without merit”.' 426 ' After denounc- 
ing chef Geoffrey Zakarian who, like Andres, withdrew 
from the Trump International Hotel project in the wake 
of Trump’s comments on Mexican illegal immigrants (and 
who was expected to lose his $500,000 restaurant lease de- 
posit as a result),' 426 ' Trump sued Zakarian in August 2015 
for a sum “in excess of $10 million” for lost rent and other 
damages.' 427 ' Trump’s lawsuit called Zakarian’s offense at 
his remarks “curious in light of the fact that Mr. Trump’s 
publicly shared views on immigration have remained con- 
sistent for many years, and Mr. Trump’s willingness to 
frankly share his opinions is widely known.”' 427 ' 

Allegations of business with firms linked to organized 
crime 

Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist David Cay Johnston, as 
well as investigative journalist Wayne Barrett who wrote 
an unauthorized 1992 Trump biography, have alleged that 
Trump and his companies did business with New York 
and Philadelphia families linked to the Italian-American 
Mafia.' 428 " 429 ' According to the Washington Post, “He was 
never accused of illegality, and observers of the time say 
that working with the mob-related figures and politicos 
came with the territory.”' 430 ' 

Johnston and Barrett claim that Trump purchased the fu- 
ture site of Atlantic City’s Trump Plaza for twice its market 
value from the Philadelphia crime family member Salvatore 
Testa, and according to the State of New Jersey Commis- 
sion of Investigation’s 1986 report on organized crime, con- 
structed the casino using two firms controlled by Nicodemo 
Scarfo.' 429 ' Although Trump was a federal target in a 1979 
bribery investigation, and was later questioned in a 1981 
racketeering probe, neither investigation resulted in crimi- 
nal charges.' 429 ' Trump was criticized for omitting mention 
of that investigation in his New Jersey casino license ap- 
plication. Johnston alleged that Trump had persuaded state 
officials to limit the background investigation of him.' 428 ' 
Johnston and other investigative reporters also reported that 
Trump Tower, Trump Plaza, and other New York City 
properties were constructed with concrete purchased from 
S&A Concrete Co., a firm owned by Anthony Salerno, head 
of the Genovese crime family, and Paul Castellano, head of 
the Gambino crime family.' 428 " 430 ' 

According to British investigative journalist John Sweeney, 
Trump walked out of an interview for the BBC’s Panorama

series with Sweeney after Trump answered a question about 
why he continued to do business with Felix Sater, an ex- 
convict who identified himself a “senior advisor to Don- 
ald Trump” (a claim disputed by Trump’s representatives), 
after Sater’s mafia and Russian criminal ties, as well as 
a 1998 racketeering conviction for a $40 million Mafia- 
linked stock fraud scheme, 14311 were publicly reported in 
20 07. 14321 14331 14341 Sater’s fraud victims included Holocaust 
survivors Ernest and Judit Gottdiener, whose estate later 
sued Sater and a business partner for failing to pay $7 mil- 
lion in restitution. 14351 Sater moved into a Trump Tower of- 
fice on the same floor as Trump’s office in 2010, according 
to court records and Associated Press interviews. 14311 “Felix 
Sater, boy, I have to even think about it”. Trump told the AP 
in December 2015. “I'm not that familiar with him.” 14311 
When previously asked about Sater by The New York Times 
in December 2007, Trump said of Sater “We never knew 
that. We do as much of a background check as we can on 
the principals. I didn’t really know him very well.” 14331 Sater 
was born in Russia in 1966 and emigrated to the U.S. with 
his family at the age of 8, 14331 and later developed ties to 
members of the Bonanno and Genovese crime families. 14361 
He worked with Trump on at least four projects includ- 
ing Trump SoHo, Trump International Hotel and Residence 
Phoenix (which failed 14361 ). Trump International Hotel and 
Residence Ft. Lauderdale (which collapsed amid allega- 
tions of fraud 14371 ), and an unrealized skyscraper project in 
Denver which involved Sater traveling with Trump to the 
city 1445 and being interviewed with Trump by The Rocky 
Mountain News in 20 05. 14331 Alan Garten, senior attorney 
for Trump, said that Sater has “got a lot of contacts” and 
worked with Trump scouting high-end luxury real estate op- 
portunities, but was never formally employed, and did not 
close any deals for Trump over the course of a six-month 
non-contractual working relationship in 2010. 14311 “If Mr. 
Sater was good enough for the government to work with”, 
referring to the cooperation agreement which kept Sater’s 
racketeering conviction sealed from public scrutiny for 14 
years, “I see no reason why he wasn't good enough for Mr. 
Trump.” [43I] 


Campaign contributions 

According to a New York state report. Trump “circum- 
vented” corporate and personal campaign donation limits 
in the 1980s by donating money to candidates from 18 
different business subsidiaries, rather than giving primar- 
ily in his own name. 14301 Trump told investigators he did 
so on the advice of lawyers, and not to curry favor with 
business-friendly candidates, but simply to satisfy requests 
from friends. 14301

Spouses 


2.1 Ivana Trump 

Ivana Marie Trump (nee Zelnickova; Czech pronuncia- 
tion: ['ivana 'marije 'zeljmtjkova:]; February 20, 1949) 
is a Czech-American socialite and former fashion model, 
known for her marriage to American business magnate 
Donald Trump. 

2.1.1 Early years 

Ivana Zelnickova was born in the Moravian town of then 
Gottwaldov (formerly/presently known as Zlin), the daugh- 
ter of Milos Zelnicek and Marie Francova. 1 1 From a very 
young age, her father nurtured and encouraged her skiing 
talent. She has claimed that she was selected as an alternate 
on the 1972 Czechoslovak Olympic Ski Team. However, 
in 1989, Petr Pomezny, Secretary General of the Czech 
Olympic Committee, stated, “Who is this Ivana woman, 
and why do people keep calling us about her? We have 
searched so many times and have consulted many, many 
people, and there is no such girl in our records.”® 

In the early 1970s she earned a master’s degree in physical 
education from Charles University of Prague. 

2.1.2 Personal life 

In 1971, she married real estate agent Alfred Winklemeier, 
but they were divorced in 1973. 131 She left Czechoslovakia 
for Canada to be with a childhood friend, George Syrovatka, 
who owned a ski boutique there. For the following two 
years she lived in Montreal, improved her English taking 
night courses at McGill University, and worked as a model 
for some of Canada’s top fur companies. She then left Sy- 
rovatka and moved to New York to promote the Montreal 
Olympics. 

It was in New York that she met Donald Trump, son of 
prominent real estate developer Fred Trump. On April 7, 
1977, she married Donald in a lavish society wedding. Don- 


ald and Ivana Trump became leading figures in New York 
society during the 1980s. They set to work on several mas- 
sive projects, including the construction of the Grand Hy- 
att Hotel, the Trump Taj Mahal Casino Resort in Atlantic 
City, New Jersey, and the Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue 
in Manhattan. 141151 They had three children: Donald John 
Jr. (born December 31, 1977), Ivanka Marie (born Octo- 
ber 30, 1981), and Eric Fredrick (born January 6, 1984). 
She has seven grandchildren. 161 

Ivana took a major role in the Trump Organization. She 
became the Vice President of Interior Design for the com- 
pany, spearheading the signature design of Trump Tower. 
Afterwards, her then husband appointed her to head up the 
Trump Castle Hotel and Casino as president. Ivana be- 
came a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1988, with Donald at her 
side.® 

In the late 1980s, Ivana decided to leave Atlantic City in 
order to devote more time to her family. However, her hus- 
band asked her to oversee the restoration of the landmark 
Plaza Hotel, and she took over as its president. She was 
named Hotelier of the Year in 1990. Ivana’s work at the 
Plaza would be the zenith of her work within the Trump 
Organization. Towards the end of that year, rumors began 
to circulate that her husband was having an affair with a for- 
mer beauty queen from Georgia, Marla Maples. While the 
family was on holiday in Aspen, Colorado that Christmas, 
she encountered Maples on the ski slopes; their confronta- 
tion was reported in the New York Post the following day. 
In 1991, she retained entertainment attorney Neil Papiano 
and hied for divorce, seeking a greater amount of the family 
fortune than had been set out in her prenuptial agreement. 
Her husband fought back in court, protesting Ivana’s claims 
that she had contributed to the Trump Organization. 

The divorce proceedings led to extensive pieces in the gos- 
sip columns. In October 1990 her 63-year-old father died 
suddenly from a heart attack. The Trumps stood side-by- 
side at the funeral. 181 Their divorce was settled after that 
in 1992. 191 Although the settlement remains sealed by the 
courts, it is rumored that Ivana received $20 million; the 


34 


2.1. IV AN A TRUMP 


35 


$14 million family estate in Connecticut; a $5 million hous- 
ing allowance; $350,000 annual alimony; all of her jewelry; 
and 49% of Mar-a-Lago, the family home in Palm Beach, 
Florida, that also serves as a private club for the Palm Beach 
elite. Not long after her divorce from Donald, Ivana mar- 
ried Riccardo Mazzucchelli. The marriage was dissolved 
before two years had elapsed, and Ivana filed a $15 million 
breach of contract suit against Mazzucchelli for violating 
the confidentiality clause in their prenuptial agreement. The 
suit was settled out of court. 

In April 2008, Ivana, then 59, married Rossano Rubicondi, 
then 36. [10] The $3 million wedding for 400 guests was 
hosted by Donald at his Mar-a-Lago estate. Trump’s daugh- 
ter Ivanka, of the reality show The Apprentice, was her maid 
of honor. 1111 On December 1, 2008, Trump confirmed to 
the Associated Press that she had filed a legal separation 
agreement three months previously; she has stated in inter- 
views that she and her husband have an on-again/off-again 
relationship. 

2.1.3 Career 

Soon after her divorce from Donald Trump, she signed 
on with the William Morris Agency and developed lines 
of clothing, fashion jewelry and beauty products that have 
been successfully sold through television shopping chan- 
nels. She has also written several bestselling books includ- 
ing the novels For Love Alone, Lucy Wilkins and Free to 
Love as well as a self-help book The Best is Yet to Come: 
Coping with Divorce and Enjoying Life Again. In 2001, 
she penned an advice column for Divorce Magazine^ 12 She 
played a cameo role in the Hollywood film The First Wives 
Club with the memorable line, “Remember girls: don't get 
mad, get everything.” 

She was the host of Oxygen Network's reality-dating series 
Ivana Young Man in 2006. In 2010, Ivana sued a Finnish 
fashion company, accusing it of selling women’s clothing 
that incorporates her name without permission. 1131 In the 
same year, she took part in the UK’s Celebrity Big Brother, 
finishing seventh. 1141 

2.1.4 In popular culture 

In the former Disney sitcoms The Suite Life of Zack and 
Cody and The Suite Life on Deck, main character London 
Tipton's dog’s is named Ivana after the ex-Trump. 

In the 1996 movie adaptation of The First Wives Club, 
Ivana makes a brief appearance at the end gala. 

Absolutely Fabulous creator Jennifer Saunders has admitted 
that the character Patsy Stone (who shares Trump’s charac- 
teristic blond beehive) is partially based on Trump. 1 131 


In the John David Coles-directed TV movie Trump Unau- 
thorized (2005), Ivana is portrayed by actress Katheryn 

Winnick. 

Actress Michaela Watkins portrays Ivana in the Funny or 

Die parody film Donald Trump’s The Art of the Deal: The 

Movie.

The Apprentice In 2006, she filled in for Carolyn Kepcher 
on five episodes of her father’s television program The Ap- 
prentice 5, first appearing to help judge the Gillette task 
in week 2. 117 Like Kepcher, Trump visited the site of the 
tasks and spoke to the teams, asking them pointed ques- 
tions. She also evaluated contestants in the boardroom, 
pointing out critical errors and rebutting excuses they of- 
fered for losing the tasks. Though initially unsympathetic 
to the contestants. Trump later said, “Whenever I see their 
breakdowns, I understand. They go virtually 24 hours a 
day, and each task takes about three days. Unless they 
win, they don't get a day off... It’s an incredible amount 
of work...” 1131 Trump now collaborates with season 5 win- 
ner Sean Yazbeck on his winner’s project of choice. Trump

and inflections in her. David Letterman also made a simi- 
lar comment when she appeared on Late Show with David

and has defended him. 1271 1281 However, she admitted mixed 
feelings about his presidential ambitions, saying, “As a citi- 
zen, I love what he’s doing. As a daughter, it’s obviously 
more complicated.” 1291 In August, Trump’s father stated 
that she was his leading advisor on “women’s health and 
women” and said it was she who propelled him to elaborate 
on his views of women. 13011311 In January 2016, Trump was

ing the Jewish Sabbath, saying in 2015: “We're pretty ob- 
servant... It’s been such a great life decision for me... I re- 
ally find that with Judaism, it creates an amazing blueprint 
for family connectivity. From Friday to Saturday we don't 
do anything but hang out with one another. We don't make 
phone calls.” 1401 

Trump meditates twice daily, and has gifted a meditation 
course led by her friend Bob Roth to the members of “Team

deep.” [40]

ther defended their safari via Twitter, affirming their ac- 
tions as hunters and longtime advocates of the outdoors. [14)

saying that he fully supported his sons. 1 141

Father 


4.1 Fred Trump 

This article is about the real estate developer. For his 
father, see Frederick Trump. 

Frederick Christ “Fred” Trump (October 11, 1905 - 
June 25, 1999) was an American real estate developer. He 
was the father of businessman Donald Trump and United 
States Appeals Judge Maryanne Trump Barry. 

4.1.1 Early life 

Trump was born on East Tremont Avenue in the Bronx, to 
German immigrants Elizabeth (nee Christ) and Frederick 
Trump. 111 His father had immigrated to New York City in 
1885 from the small German town of Kallstadt, Rhineland - 
Palatinate, where he briefly returned around 1900, married, 
and reimmigrated. 

Although both of Trump’s parents were born in Germany, 
Trump told friends and acquaintances for decades after 
World War II that the family was of Swedish origin. Ac- 
cording to his nephew John Walter, “He had a lot of Jewish 
tenants and it wasn't a good thing to be German in those 
days.” 121 

4.1.2 Business career 

In 1927, at age 22, Fred Trump went into the real estate 
development and construction business, forming Elizabeth 
Trump & Son Co. with his mother Elizabeth Christ Trump, 
who was an active partner, writing the checks. 131 

In the late 1920s Trump began building single-family 
houses in Queens, which were sold for $3,990 each. By 
the mid- 1930s in the middle of the Great Depression, he 
helped pioneer the concept of supermarkets with the Trump 
Market in Woodhaven, which advertised “Serve Yourself 
and Save!", becoming an instant hit. 121 After only a year 
Trump sold it for a tidy profit to the King Kullen supermar- 


ket chain. 121 King Kullen continues to operate in the Suffolk 
County area today. 141 

During World War II, Trump built barracks and garden 
apartments for U.S. Navy personnel near major shipyards 
along the East Coast, including Chester, Pennsylvania, 
Newport News, Virginia, and Norfolk, Virginia. After 
the war he expanded into middle-income housing for the 
families of returning veterans, building Shore Haven in 
Bensonhurst in 1949, and Beach Haven near Coney Island 
in 1950 (a total of 2,700 apartments). In 1963 he built the 
3,800-apartment Trump Village in Coney Island, compet- 
ing with Lefrak City in Queens. In testimony before the 
Senate Banking Committee in 1954, William F. McKenna, 
appointed to investigate “scandals” within the FHA, cited 
Fred C. Trump and his partner William Tomasello as ex- 
amples of how profits were made by builders using the 
FHA. McKenna said the two paid $34,200 for a piece of 
land which they then rented to their corporation for over 
$60,000 per year in a 99 year lease, so that if the apartment 
they built on it ever defaulted, the FHA would owe $1.5 
million on it. McKenna said that Trump and Tomasello 
then obtained loans for $3.5 million more than the apart- 
ments cost. 151 Trump testified before the Senate Banking 
Committee the following month as it investigated “windfall 
profits.” He said that builders would not have built apart- 
ments under an expired post-war loan insurance program if 
regulations had set inflexible limits on loans issued by the 
FHA. 161 In September 1954, following Trump’s testimony, 
2,500 tenants of the Beachhaven apartments sued Trump 
and the FHA, claiming the builder made windfall profits 
and that the builder had received loans for $4 million more 
than the construction actually cost, and that rents were con- 
sequently inappropriately inflated. 171 

Trump went on to build and operate affordable rental hous- 
ing via large apartment complexes in New York City, in- 
cluding more than 27,000 low-income multifamily apart- 
ments and row houses in the neighborhoods of Coney Is- 
land, Bensonhurst, Sheepshead Bay, Flatbush, and Brighton 
Beach in Brooklyn, and Flushing and Jamaica Estates in 
Queens. 121 In 1968 his 22-year-old son Donald Trump

joined his company Trump Management Co., becoming 
president in 1974, and renaming it The Trump Organiza- 
tion in 1980. In the mid-1970s he lent his son money, al- 
lowing him to go into the real estate business in Manhattan, 
while Fred stuck to Brooklyn and Queens. “It was good for 
me,” Donald later commented. “You know, being the son 
of somebody, it could have been competition to me. This 
way, I got Manhattan all to myself.” 121 

Folk icon Woody Guthrie, who from 1950, was a tenant 
in one of Fred Trump’s apartment complexes in Brooklyn, 
chronicled his disgust with Trump as a landlord, penning 
lyrics which accused him of stirring up racial hate “in the 
bloodpot of human hearts”. 181 

Although a millionaire. Trump was known for his frugality, 
saving unused nails, doing his own extermination work and 
mixing his own floor cleaners. Nevertheless, he insisted on 
buying a new navy blue Cadillac every three years, with li- 
cense plate “FCT”. 191 By the time of his death. Trump was 
estimated to have amassed a fortune worth $250 to $300 
million. 121 

4.1.3 Civil rights lawsuit 

In 1973, the U.S. Justice Department’s Civil Rights Divi- 
sion filed a civil rights suit against the Trump organization 
charging that it refused to rent to black people. The Urban 
League had sent black and white testers to apply for apart- 
ments in Trump-owned complexes; the whites got the apart- 
ments, the blacks didn't. According to court records, four 
superintendents or rental agents reported that applications 
sent to the central office for acceptance or rejection were 
coded by race. A 1979 Village Voice article quoted a rental 
agent who said Trump instructed him not to rent to black 
people and to encourage existing black tenants to leave. 
In 1975, a consent decree described by the head of DOJ’s 
housing division as “one of the most far-reaching ever nego- 
tiated,” required Trump to advertise vacancies in minority 
papers and list vacancies with the Urban League. The Jus- 
tice Department subsequently complained that continuing 
“racially discriminatory conduct by Trump agents has oc- 
curred with such frequency that it has created a substantial 
impediment to the full enjoyment of equal opportunity.” 1101 

4.1.4 Personal life 

On June 1, 1927, a New York Times article reported that 
a “Fred Trump” was arrested and discharged after an inci- 
dent with members of the Ku Klux Klan turned into a brawl 
with Queens police. The brawl reportedly consisted of over 
1,000 Klansmen and 100 police officers, with Fred Trump 
being one of seven men arrested. An internet blog later re- 
discovered the article, and noted Trump would have been 


around the age of twenty-one. It stated “this is not proof that 
Trump senior — who would later go on to become a million- 
aire real estate developer — was a member of the Ku Klux 
Klan or even in attendance at the event. Despite sharing 
lawyers with the other men, it’s conceivable that he may 
have been an innocent bystander, falsely named, or other- 
wise the victim of mistaken identity during or following a 
chaotic event.” 1111 And yet, the article states Fred Trump’s 
address to have been 175-24 Devonshire Road, Jamaica, so 
verification of his identity is possible to someone with ac- 
cess to period records. 

In 1936, Trump married Scottish immigrant Mary Anne 
MacLeod (born May 10, 1912, Stornoway, Scotland; died 
August 7, 2000, New Hyde Park, New York). 1121 The cou- 
ple had five children: 11311141 Maryanne (born 1937), a fed- 
eral appeals court judge; Frederick “Fred” Jr. (1938-81); 
Elizabeth (born 1942), 1151 an executive assistant at Chase 
Manhattan Bank; Donald (born 1946); and Robert (born 
1948), president of his father’s property management com- 
pany. Fred, Jr. predeceased his father when he died of 
complications of alcoholism in 198 1. 1 161 

Trump suffered from Alzheimer’s disease for six years. He 
became sick with pneumonia in June 1999 121 at Long Island 
Jewish Medical Center in New Hyde Park. 1 171

Television Career 


5.1 "The Apprentice" 


The Apprentice is an American reality game show that 
judges the business skills of a group of contestants. It is 
closely associated with real estate magnate, businessman, 
and television personality, Donald Trump, who hosted 14 
seasons of the show from its inception in January 2004 un- 
til 2015. The show is broadcast on NBC. It was created 
by English-born American television producer Mark Bur- 
nett. Billed as “The Ultimate Job Interview”, the show fea- 
tures sixteen to eighteen business people who compete over 
the course of a season, with usually one contestant elimi- 
nated per episode. The original prize for the first six sea- 
sons was a one-year, $250,000 starting contract to run one 
of Trump’s companies. Each episode typically ended with 
Trump eliminating one of the contestants with the words, 
“You're fired” (which has become a locution of both the 
program and Trump). 

After six seasons of The Apprentice , a new format was intro- 
duced: The Celebrity Apprentice. The celebrity series gen- 
erally follows the same premise as the original, but with 
celebrities as contestants participating to win money for 
their chosen charities, rather than winning a job opportu- 
nity. There have been seven seasons of The Celebrity Ap- 
prentice since 2008. In 2010, a seventh (and the most re- 
cent) season of the original Apprentice was aired in between 
Celebrity seasons. There were a combined 14 seasons of 
Trump’s Apprentice. Another season of The Celebrity Ap- 
prentice is planned to air in 2016-17, to be hosted by ac- 
tor, politician and businessman Arnold Schwarzenegger, af- 
ter Donald Trump announced his candidacy for the 2016 
US presidential election and caused controversy surround- 
ing his views of Muslims and Mexicans. 1 * 1 

The U.S. series originated a franchise of international tele- 
vision shows collectively known as The Apprentice, which 
has had over 20 local versions. The series also spawned an- 
other U.S. series. The Apprentice: Martha Stewart, featuring 
lifestyle mogul Martha Stewart, which ran for one season in 
2005. 


5.1.1 Premise 

The Apprentice is a reality television show featuring season- 
long competitions. Each season begins with a new group 
of contestants vying to earn a place in one of the organiza- 
tions run by the host (previously, Donald Trump). The con- 
testants (who are referred to as “candidates”) come from 
business backgrounds in various enterprises, but typically 
included backgrounds in real estate, accounting, restaurant 
management, management consulting, sales, and market- 
ing. 

During the show, the contestants live in a communal 
dwelling (for almost all seasons, a supposed “penthouse 
suite”). The candidates are divided into two teams. Each 
week, the teams are assigned a task and required to select 
one of their members to lead the team as “project manager”. 
Tasks are generally business oriented and tend to highlight 
one of several business skills. Tasks most commonly re- 
volve around sales (selling the most items or earning the 
most money); and marketing (producing a specific market- 
ing material or campaign that is judged by a company’s ex- 
ecutives). During the tasks, the teams are usually visited 
by one of Trump’s two “advisors” for that week. In early 
seasons, the show included segments of Trump speaking 
directly to the audience with business advice typically rel- 
evant to that episode’s task. After the completion of the 
task, the teams meet with the host and his two advisers in 
“the boardroom". 

Boardroom meetings generally proceed in three stages. In 
the first preliminary stage, all of the remaining candidates 
on both teams gather in the boardroom to be debriefed on 
the task by the host and his advisors. Team members are 
asked about how the task went and whether there were any 
strong or weak players. Teams are sometimes asked to com- 
ment on materials or products produced by the opposing 
team. At the end of this stage, the host or his advisors would 
reveal the results of the task and which team was the winner. 
The winning team wins a reward (usually a unique, luxuri- 
ous experience) and are excused from the boardroom while 
the losing team returns to the boardroom for an elimination. 


51 


52 


CHAPTER 5. TELEVISION CAREER 


In later seasons, winning teams have been permitted to view 
the next stage of the boardroom on the TV in their suite. 

The entire losing team remains in the boardroom and are 
confronted with their loss. They are interrogated as to the 
reasons for their loss and which players contributed to or 
failed at the task. Then, for the final stage of the board- 
room, the project manager is asked to select a certain num- 
ber of teammates (typically two, but on occasion one or 
three) to bring back into the final-stage boardroom meet- 
ing. The remaining teammates return to the suite while the 
project manager and the selected teammates stepped out of 
the boardroom momentarily so the host can consult his ad- 
visors. 

Upon returning to the boardroom for the final stage, the 
host and his advisors continue interrogating the remaining 
players about their loss. The project manager is sometimes 
further analyzed for their choice of teammates to bring 
back into the boardroom. Ultimately, at least one project 
manager and/or the remaining teammates are “fired” at the 
host’s discretion, and leave the show. 

It is notable that Trump was shown to have the ultimate 
discretion in running the boardroom and at times he would 
disregard the typical format of the show, including: firing 
multiple candidates in one week; firing candidates before 
the final stage; bringing candidates back into the final stage 
who were not chosen by the project manager and all of this 
simply because he felt like it. 

When the final three or four candidates are left (depending 
on the season), they engage in a formal interview rather than 
a task. Several executives from various companies interview 
each of the finalists and reported their assessments to the 
host. Based on the interviews, a boardroom and firing take 
place, leaving a final two candidates. 

The final two candidates are then each assigned a differ- 
ent final task, and given a support team of previously fired 
candidates. Final tasks generally require the finalists to or- 
ganize (to various degrees) an event such as a party or a 
fundraiser. In a final boardroom following the final task, 
the host hired one of the two candidates to become his “ap- 
prentice”. 


5.1.2 History and production 

The first season aired during the winter and the spring of 
2004. The Apprentice is produced and created by Mark 
Burnett and was originally hosted by real estate magnate 
Donald Trump, who also serves as co-producer of the show. 
The premise of the show, which bills itself as the “ultimate 
job interview” in the “ultimate jungle,” is to conduct a job 
talent search for a person to head one of Trump’s compa- 
nies. The position starts with an introductory 1-year con- 


tract with a starting yearly salary of $250,000. The pop- 
ularity of the show led to Trump becoming known for his 
fateful catch phrase, “You're fired!" 

The opening theme music used on the show is "For the Love 
of Money", a 1973 R&B song by The 0'Jays. [2] 

For most seasons, the candidates ostensibly live in a com- 
munal suite at Trump Tower in Manhattan. This was origi- 
nally billed as a penthouse suite, and after boardrooms, can- 
didates were told to “go up” to the suite. However, in real- 
ity, the suite and the boardroom (and its elevator lobby) are 
all purpose-built sets within Trump Tower, all on the same 
floor. Later seasons of the Celebrity Apprentice no longer 
conceal this. 

As the popularity of the series grew, more and more of the 
tasks began to be tied to specific companies. For example, 
sales tasks would require a team to take over a brand-name 
storefront or restaurant and operate it; and marketing tasks 
would require teams to prepare a marketing material (e.g. a 
jingle or flyer) or campaign for an established company. In 
later series, the launches of specific products would be tied 
to the airing of episodes of the series. Several companies 
have appeared multiple times on the show. 

Trump’s original advisors were Carolyn Kepcher, Former 
Chief Operating Officer and General Manager for the 
Trump National Golf Club, and George H. Ross, Execu- 
tive Vice President and Senior Counsel, The Trump Orga- 
nization. In August 2006, Trump released Kepcher from 
her duties at the Trump organization saying only that he 
“wishes her the best.” Kepcher also left The Apprentice at 
that time. Upon her departure, Trump’s daughter, Ivanka 
Trump became a regular advisor; though she was not offi- 
cially billed as a replacement for Kepcher. 131 As the series 
progressed, the advisors were occasionally substituted on a 
weekly basis with other advisors including two of Trump’s 
other children, Donald Trump Ir. and Eric Trump, as well 
as past winners of the show and other business executives 
(typically from the company whose product or service was 
featured in the episode. 

During Trump’s tenure, the series frequently featured and 
promoted his properties, products and brand. Trump’s wife 
Melania Trump was also featured on the series several times 
including in several tasks that have featured her fashion and 
cosmetic products. Ivanka Trump’s fashion products have 
also been featured in tasks. 

Trump’s on-screen (and real-life) assistants have each 
grown in personal fame. Two assistants appeared jointly 
for the first five seasons: Rhona Graff and Robin Himmler. 
In the sixth season. Trump elected to have his newest exec- 
utive assistant, Andi Rowntree, star in the LA-based show. 
For the Celebrity Apprentice, Annette Dziamba appeared 
for the seventh season, and Amanda Miller since the eighth

season. 

Season 6, unlike the rest of the series, took place in Los 
Angeles. The teams resided in a mansion, with the winning 
team of each challenge occupying the house, and the losing 
team camping out in tents in the backyard. 

On May 14, 2007, the series was left off NBC’s schedule but 
NBC Entertainment president Kevin Reilly said he was still 
in discussions with Mark Burnett and Trump. 141 On May 19, 
2007, Trump announced that He was “moving on from The 
Apprentice to a major new TV venture”. 151 On May 22, NBC 
announced The Apprentice might return next season even 
though Trump had said he had quit. 161 However, NBC and 
Trump resolved their differences, and the first season of The 
Celebrity Apprentice began production shortly thereafter. 

5.1.3 Spin-offs 

The Apprentice also spawned a reality television dating 
game show. On June 17, 2010, Donald J. Trump Presents 
The Ultimate Merger premiered on TV One. The series stars 
Omarosa Manigault-Stallworth, a former political consul- 
tant who in 2004 appeared on the first season of The Ap- 
prentice and once again in 2008 on the first celebrity edition 
of the show. 171 Each of the twelve contestants vying for the 
affections of Manigault-Stallworth were selected by Trump 
himself.® 

Martha Stewart 

See also: The Apprentice: Martha Stewart 

On February 2, 2005, NBC announced that they would 
broadcast the first spin-off from The Apprentice, called The 
Apprentice: Martha Stewart. The show, which ran from 
September 21 to December 21, 2005 was hosted by Martha 
Stewart, who was the first woman in the world to become a 
self-made billionaire. It kept the format of the original se- 
ries but changed a few elements to fit Stewart’s personality. 
Trump was one of the executive producers of the show and 
castings were held in 27 cities across the United States. 

At the time, the original Apprentice was airing new seasons 
in each of the fall and winter, each with declining overall 
ratings. The Apprentice: Martha Stewart aired on Wednes- 
days during the same fall season as the fourth season of 
the original Apprentice (which aired Thursdays). The Ap- 
prentice: Martha Stewart struggled while the original series’ 
fourth season again earned poorer ratings than the previous 
season. Trump claimed that there was “confusion” between 
the two shows. There has also been talk that Trump did not 
want Stewart to host the spin-off show. NBC announced 
that it would not bring back the show for a second season. 


although the network stressed that the show was initially 
planned to air only for one season. The show averaged be- 
tween six and seven million viewers. Before Stewart’s show 
ended. Trump and Stewart had a fight over Stewart accusing 
Trump that he did not want her to have a successful show, 
that he might have wanted it jinxed. Trump denied this 
charge, and both TV stars have not worked together again, 
and there are no plans for the future. 


5.1.4 Statistics by season 

Seasonal rankings (based on average total viewers per 
episode) of The Apprentice on NBC. 

Note: Each U.S. network television season starts in late 
September and ends in late May, which coincides with the 
completion of May sweeps. 

(Note: Given the show has a sequel TV 
series known as Celebrity Apprentice, 
the above chart is continued on the ar- 
ticle of the show's follow-up TV se- 
ries, found under “statistics by season” 
for Celebrity Apprentice. Note as well 
that season 10 is included in the above 
chart given the show reverted back to 
The Apprentice for that season) 

The Apprentice was the breakout rookie hit of the 2003-04 
U.S. television season and helped NBC at a time when the 
network’s two long-running successful comedies. Friends 
and Frasier, were ending their series’ runs. The Appren- 
tice filled the void on Thursday nights as NBC held on to 
the tagline Must See TV, even though CBS was quickly be- 
coming the most-watched network on Thursday night. 

Although the series was one of the most-watched programs 
on NBC in the advertiser-friendly 18-49 age demographic, 
the franchise’s total audience gradually dissolved, starting in 
late 2004, when it aired its second season that culminated 
in, what most Apprentice fans deem, an “overextended” 1 ly| 
3-hour season finale on December 16, 2004. 

The audience numbers (11.25 million viewers) 1201 for the 
June 5, 2006 fifth season finale were not factored in the fifth 
season average because it aired after the official television 
season ended. 

The audience numbers for the show steadily declined fol- 
lowing the first season. Originally, NBC aired the sixth sea- 
son of The Apprentice , competing against both immensely 
popular series. Desperate Housewives and Cold Case, just a 
few weeks before competing against Brothers & Sisters and 
Cold Case.

5.1.6 Controversies 

Whereas winners have been named “executive vice pres- 
idents”, and given the title of “owner’s representative,” 
in actuality, they were employed as publicity spokespeo- 
ple for the Trump Organization. Second season winner 
Kelly Perdew, on his first day working for Trump, was 
introduced by his boss to Florida developers working on 
a Trump-branded condo, the Trump Tower, in Tampa, 
Florida, where he was told that he would help promote sales 
of the building by appearing at promotional events. 1211 

In the wake of Trump’s statements about the current pres- 
ident of the United States, Barack Obama, The Apprentice 
has been criticized for its involvement with Trump. There 
have been public calls for NBC to fire Trump from his role 
on The Apprentice - most notably from sister-network lib- 
eral political commentator Lawrence O'Donnell and from 
the former US Congressman Anthony Weiner. 1221 Indus- 
try media has speculated on the extent to which Trump’s 
media comments may have contributed to the decrease in 
the show’s ratings, 12311241 as other Trump-associated busi- 
nesses have suffered since the start of Trump’s political 
campaign. 1251 One (anonymous) Celebrity Apprentice con- 
testant even announced an intention to boycott the May 15 
taping of the season 7 finale, unless forced by contract to 
appear. 1261 [271 

5.1.7 Video game 

Legacy Interactive created a video game version of The Ap- 
prentice for the PC. It features Donald Trump and his advi- 
sors, as well as past candidates, and is currently available on 
Yahoo! Games. The player selects either a male or a female 
character to play and must control the character through a 
number of tasks including puzzles. The character must cre- 
ate a billboard; sell ice cream, Italian food, or hamburgers; 
help create toys, chocolates and lamps; and sell items in dif- 
ferent neighborhoods.

5.2 " The Celebrity Apprentice ' ' 

The Celebrity Apprentice is an American television reality 
game show. It is a variation of The Apprentice series which 
was previously hosted by real estate magnate, businessman 
and television personality Donald Trump. Also like its pre- 
cursor, the show’s opening theme song is "For the Love 
of Money" by The O'Jays. Unlike its precursor, however. 
Celebrity Apprentice consists of famous people as compet- 
ing apprentices rather than unknowns. Some of the celebri- 
ties are relatively current while others tend to be those who 
have been out of the public eye for some time. All of them 
are competing to win money for a charitable organization 
of their choice. The celebrities come from a wide vari- 
ety of different fields in the media: sitcoms, professional 
sports, music industry, reality television, radio, and other 
backgrounds. 

The Celebrity Apprentice is linked in seasons to its precursor 
TV show. The Apprentice , which consists of seasons one 
to six and season ten. The Celebrity Apprentice consists of 
seasons seven to nine and eleven onward. 

The seventh season (14th overall) premiered on Sunday, 
January 4, 2015. [1] 


5.2.1 History 

On July 6, 2007, it was announced that The Apprentice had 
been renewed for a seventh season, with a possibility of an 
eighth. 121 In an effort to revitalize interest in the series, sea- 
son seven 121 featured celebrities playing the game to raise 
money for charities, going under the name The Celebrity 
Apprentice as opposed to continuing under The Apprentice 
format. British tabloid editor Piers Morgan was declared 
the winner of that season. On January 28, 2008, NBC con- 
firmed that season eight would feature celebrities playing 
the game to raise money for charity. That season premiered 
in March 2009, and resulted in a win for comedian Joan 
Rivers. 141 

Season three of The Celebrity Apprentice aired in the spring 
of 2010, and was won by musician Bret Michaels. 

On March 17, 2010, NBC officially stated that a new season 
of the original Apprentice would be brought back, with the 
explanation that regular working people would again attract 
audiences in light of the damaged U.S. economy. That sea- 
son premiered September 16, 2010. 151 This time the ratings 
were low, and both Trump and Producer Mark Burnett re- 
turned to the 'Celebrity' format, which saw John Rich win 
in season four. In season five, late night host Arsenio Hall 
won. In season six, the first all-star season took place, bring- 
ing back 14 of the most memorable celebrities to compete 
for the first title of the All-Star Celebrity Apprentice, which

country singer Trace Adkins won. In season seven, Donald 
Trump returned the show to regular Celebrity Apprentice, 
TV anchor and talk show host Leeza Gibbons won the sea- 
son. 

In June 2015, after Trump made remarks, widely consid- 
ered as offensive, 161 regarding illegal immigrants from Mex- 
ico, 171 NBC announced that it would no longer do busi- 
ness with him. In September 2015, the network announced 
that former Governor of California Arnold Schwarzeneg- 
ger would be the new host and said the next season would 
premiere sometime in the 2016-17 TV season. 181

Business Career 


6.1 The Trump Organization 

The Trump Organization LLC [2] is a privately owned 
multinational conglomerate based in TrumpTower in 
Manhattan, New York. Donald Trump worked for his 
father’s firm, Elizabeth Trump & Son, while attending the 
Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, and in 
1968 officially joined the company. 161 He was given control 
of the company in 1971 PH 8 ! and renamed it Trump Enter- 
prises LLC in August 1999 before changing it to Trump 
Organization LLC in November 1999. 121 The company has 
interests in real estate development, investing, brokerage, 
sales and marketing, and property management. The com- 
pany owns, operates, invests, and develops residential real 
estate, hotels, resorts, residential towers, and golf courses 
in different countries, as well as owning several hundred 
thousand square feet of prime Manhattan real estate. The 
organization also has a stake in Trump Entertainment Re- 
sorts, which owned the Trump Taj Mahal, the Trump Plaza, 
and the Trump Marina casinos in Atlantic City, New Jersey. 

The company serves as the principal holding company for 
Trump’s business ventures and investments. The Trump or- 
ganization lists involvement in 515 subsidiaries and enti- 
ties with 264 of them bearing Trump’s name and another 
54 including his initials. [9][10I[11 ^ 12 ^ 13] With investments 
within the United States, Europe, Asia, the Middle East and 
other parts of the world. The Trump Organization spans a 
wide variety of industries including real estate, construc- 
tion, hospitality, entertainment, book and magazine pub- 
lishing, media, model management, retail, financial ser- 
vices, board game development, food and beverages, busi- 
ness education, online travel, airlines, helicopter air services 
and beauty pageants. 1911141 

In addition to real estate along with all the other invest- 
ments and entities, other business operations within the 
company include restaurants, a modeling agency and beauty 
pageants; public skating rink management; and a New 
York television production company that produces televi- 
sion programs which include the reality television program. 
The Apprenticed The Miss Universe Organization is also 


owned by the Trump Organization and together with the 
National Broadcasting Company produces the Miss Uni- 
verse, Miss USA, and Miss Teen USA pageants. |16][17] Fur- 
thermore, the company engages in retailing providing qual- 
ity fashion apparel, home furnishings, jewelry and acces- 
sories, books, chocolate bars, furniture, lighting products, 
bath textiles and accessories, bedding and home fragrance 
products, small leather goods, crystal stemware, barware 
and gifts, and bottled spring water. 1181 A small portion of 
Trump’s fortune are held in assets outside his holdings in 
the Trump Organization, largely concentrated in the finan- 
cial market. [19][2 ° lt21] 

The organization is owned and managed by the Trump fam- 
ily with Donald Trump and three of his eldest children — 
Donald Trump Jr., Ivanka Trump, and Eric Trump — 
serving as EVPs within the organization.

ings were worth about US$3.5 billion with a value of com- 
mercial properties totaled at US$1.3 billion, his residen- 
tial properties at US$410 million, and his club facilities 
at US$866 million, and an additional US$940 million for 
properties he has less than 100 percent stake in. 1221 Trump’s 
real estate holdings form the core of his assets and provide 
much of his income, with a wide array of real estate licens- 
ing, branding and marketing deals and royalties that pro- 
vide millions in annual cash flow. 116112311241 In 2015, Trump 
earned $7 1 million from condo sales and collects $41 .9 mil- 
lion in rental income on his buildings annually. 1251

CHAPTER 6. BUSINESS CAREER 






Trump Turnberry golf course in Scotland 


In 2006, Trump purchased a 1,400-acre (5.7 km2) plot 
just north of Aberdeen at Menie (Balmedie), Scotland, with 
the intention of turning it into a £1 billion golf resort and 
“the world’s best golf course” capable of hosting world class 
events such as The Open Championship. 1431 There has been 
opposition from many people both locally and in other parts 
of Scotland and the UK, and negative reaction from a num- 
ber of environmental groups, but the project continues. 

The development plan for Trump International Golf Links, 
Scotland (TIGLS) included two 18-hole courses, a 5-star 
hotel, golf villas, holiday homes, and a golf academy. It 
was strongly supported by local business leaders 1441 but met 
opposition from local residents, campaigners and environ- 
mental groups anxious to preserve the 4,000-year-old sand 
dunes that are designated an SSSI (Site of Special Sci- 
entific Interest). Though recommended for approval by 
Aberdeenshire Council officials 1 1451 the development was 
initially rejected by a local subcommittee of elected mem- 
bers. However it was subsequently approved following a 
controversial planning inquiry ordered by the Scottish Gov- 
ernment in June 2008, at which Trump personally testified. 
Work began on the site in July 20 10. 1461 

In March 2009, the Trump Organization had asked the 
Council to use its powers of compulsory purchase to ac- 
quire some areas of land at Balmedie not forming part of the 
original TIGLS site for which planning permission already 
existed. These included four family-owned properties. 1471 
In response local campaigners established Tripping Up 
Trump, a movement aimed at protecting the families at Me- 
nie being threatened with eviction. When it emerged at the 
end of January 2011 that Queen guitarist Brian May had 
agreed to the use of the band’s hit Bohemian Rhapsody in a 
film highlighting the plight of the families. Trump appeared 
to deny in a media statement that there had ever been an 
eviction threat, declaring “we have no interest in compul- 
sory purchase and have never applied for it.” 1481 


In September 2011, the Trump Organization lodged a for- 
mal objection to the proposed construction of a wind farm 
off the Aberdeenshire coast not far from the site of the new 
hotel and luxury housing. Donald Trump also wrote per- 
sonally to the First Minister of Scotland protesting mainly 
on aesthetic grounds at the proposed erection of offshore 
wind turbines, which he characterized as 'ugly'. His let- 
ter claimed that he was protesting on behalf of the Scottish 
people, 'not... merely for the benefit of Trump International 
Golf Links.’ 1491 

In 201 1, a documentary directed by Anthony Baxter called 
You've Been Trumped 15011511 was released, showing the 
situation of local residents adversely affected by the re- 
sort’s construction. It contains footage of, among oth- 
ers, economists who query the benefits claimed for the lo- 
cal economy, environmentalists critical of the damage al- 
legedly caused by the development and golfers who voice 
doubts about claims made for the resort by the Trump 
Organization. 1521 It also shows Anthony Baxter being ar- 
rested while filming by a Grampian Police officer; he was 
later released without charge. 1531 1541 Baxter has been quoted 
as saying that Trump branded the film 'boring' and Bax- 
ter himself 'a fraud'. 1551 However, the film has won several 
awards including the Hamptons Film Festival Social Justice 
Award and the Maysles Brothers Award for best documen- 
tary at the Denver Film Festival. 

Despite Trump’s threat to withdraw any further investment 
in Scotland amid the wind turbine controversy, he later pur- 
chased the prestigious Turnberry resort in Ayrshire in April 

20 1 4. 1561 1571 

In 2012, Trump bought the Doral Resort & Spa in South 
Florida out of bankruptcy for $150 million. The 800-acre 
property includes five golf courses, 700 hotel rooms, has 
a meeting and conference space, a 50,000-square-foot spa 
and an extensive retail component. Real estate experts es- 
timate current value of the land alone at Doral could ex- 
ceed $1 billion. Trump has a $125 million mortgage on the 
property. 1271 Since 2012, the Trump Organization has spent 
over $250 million in renovations. 1581 

Trump earned at least $176.4 million from 15 golf courses 
in Scotland, Ireland and across the Eastern Seaboard — 
about 41 percent of the low-end estimate of his income 
since 20 15. 1251 

Real estate licensing 

Many developers pay Donald Trump to market their proper- 
ties and be the public face for their projects. 1591 For that rea- 
son, Trump does not own many of the buildings that display 
his name. 1591 According to Forbes, this portion of Trump’s 
empire, actually run by his children, is by far his most valu- 
able with a valuation of $562 million. According to Forbes,

6.2 Trump Entertainment Resorts 

Trump Entertainment Resorts, Inc. is a gaming and 
hospitality company that owns and operates the Trump Taj 
Mahal hotel and casino in Atlantic City, New Jersey, United 
States. Formerly known as Trump Hotels & Casino Re- 
sorts, it was founded by Donald J. Trump, who is no longer 
involved in the company. It is a subsidiary of Icahn Enter- 
prises. 


6.2.1 History 



Entrance to the Trump Taj Mahal at night, Atlantic City, New Jersey 

Donald Trump began purchasing properties along the At- 
lantic City boardwalk in the early 1980s and received a 



72 


CHAPTER 6. BUSINESS CAREER 


casino license from the New Jersey Casino Control Com- 
mission (CCC) on March 15, 1982. 121 He had planned to 
build his own casino on the boardwalk, but was stalled on 
the project when Mike Rose, then CEO of Holiday Inn and 
Harrah’s approached him to manage construction of a Holi- 
day Inn Casino-Hotel. It opened in May 1984 and two years 
later Trump bought out Holiday Inn’s shares in the property 
and renamed it the Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino. 131 

In 1985, Trump purchased the nearly-complete Atlantic 
City Hilton hotel and casino property at the Atlantic ma- 
rina from Hilton Hotels for $325 million. The hotel chain 
sold the property after its application for a gaming license 
was turned down by the CCC. 14 Trump originally opened 
the property as Trump’s Castle Hotel Casino, and later re- 
named it the Trump Marina. 

In 1988, Trump purchased the unfinished Taj Mahal prop- 
erty from Resorts International for $230 million after ne- 
gotiations with Merv Griffin in which the two men divided 
the assets of the failing company. 151 The casino, at the time 
the largest in Atlantic City, would eventually cost almost $ 1 
billion by the time it opened in 1990. Trump completed the 
project using junk bonds, a decision that hurt the company 
afterward as the gaming industry struggled in a recession 
and interest rates became unmanageable. 161 [7] 

In 1995, Trump established Trump Hotels and Casino 
Resorts (THCR) as a publicly traded company, granting it 
ownership of the Trump Plaza and the under-development 
Trump Casino in Gary, Indiana. 181 The following year, 
THCR bought the Trump Taj Mahal at a valuation of $890 
million, 191 1101 and bought the Trump Castle from Trump for 
$486 million (including $355 million in assumed debt). 1111 

In 1996, the company opened Trump World’s Fair, a casino 
adjunct to the Trump Plaza. 1121 The World’s Fair was closed 
in 1999, with plans to replace it with a larger resort. 1131 

In 1999, THCR agreed to purchase the Flamingo Hilton 
Casino Kansas City for $15 million, 1141 but the deal fell 
through when Missouri gaming regulators did not approve 
the company’s gaming license by a contractual deadline. 1 151 

THCR entered a management agreement in 2000 to oper- 
ate the Spotlight 29 Casino, an Indian casino in Coachella, 
California. 1161 


Financial troubles 

Trump Entertainment Resorts and its predecessors have 
filed for Chapter 1 1 bankruptcy protection four times, in 
1991, following construction of the $l-billion Trump Taj 
Mahal, and in 2004, 2009 and 2014. 

In 2004, Trump Hotels & Casino Resorts explored vari- 
ous options for restructuring its debt, amid speculation that 


it might file for bankruptcy. A possible arrangement with 
Credit Suisse First Boston was not completed because the 
bondholders rejected it. 1 171 

On October 21, 2004, the company announced a prelim- 
inary agreement with its investors. Trump, who had been 
the majority owner, would reduce his stock ownership from 
56 percent to 27 percent. Bondholders would surrender 
some of their debt in exchange for stock. On October 27, 
the company announced that Morgan Stanley would be the 
joint lead arranger for a financing of $500 million financ- 
ing as part of the restructuring plan. On November 21, 
the company filed for bankruptcy. Trump said the filing 
was “really just a technical thing” as the best way to imple- 
ment the restructuring plan. 1181 The plan was submitted to 
the Bankruptcy Court on December 16, 2004. 

After the 2004 bankruptcy filing. Trump Hotels & Casino 
Resorts changed its name to Trump Entertainment Resorts 
(TER). 

In 2005, the company’s involvement in the Spotlight 29 
Casino ended, as the tribe bought out the casino manage- 
ment agreement for $6 million. 1 191 Later that year, TER sold 
its Indiana casino to The Majestic Star Casino, LLC for 
$253 million. 12011211 The company had also been awarded a 
license to build a second casino in Orange County, Indiana, 
but dropped this plan, due in part to the state’s concerns 
about the company’s viability. 1221 

On May 18, 2007, the company announced that it was in 
the preliminary stages of negotiating a buyout with several 
public and private firms. On July 2, 2007 Trump Entertain- 
ment Resorts announced that they could not make a deal 
with any company that they were in talks with and decided 
to take itself off the market. The company planned to lay 
off employees in order to cut costs. 1231 


2009 bankruptcy and restructuring 

The casino group filed for bankruptcy again in February 
2009 1241 owing $1.2 billion. Two sets of debt holders even- 
tually proposed reorganization plans for the group in U.S. 
bankruptcy court. 

Trump initially made an agreement with banker/high-stakes 
poker player Andrew Beal, owner of Beal Bank, which held 
$500 million in the group’s debt, to take over the resorts. 
However, citing concerns about the bank’s experience with 
gaming, he dropped them in favor of the hedge fund Avenue 
Capital Management, a plan favored by other bond-holders. 
Beal then partnered with investor, Carl Icahn, who had 
worked on restructuring another Atlantic City casino, the 
Tropicana. 1251 In court. Trump argued that he would fight 
the Icahn/Beal team if they sought to use his name and 
likeness on the group’s properties. 1261 Instead he signed an 


6. 2. TRUMP ENTERTAINMENT RESORTS 


73 


agreement with Avenue Capital in which he would receive 
5% stock in the reorganized company and another 5% in 
exchange for the use of his name and likeness in perpetu- 
ity. 

Judith H. Wizmur, Chief Judge of the United States 
Bankruptcy Court for the District of New Jersey, eventu- 
ally sided with the Trump/ Avenue partnership, favored by 
bond holders who believed that Trump’s brand would result 
in a stronger company after reorganization. 1271 

In 201 1, TER sold the Trump Marina to Landry’s Restau- 
rants, which also operates the Golden Nugget in Las 
Vegas. 1281 


Post-bankruptcy 

In Lebruary 2013, the company agreed to sell the Trump 
Plaza for $20 million to the Meruelo Group, a California- 
based company whose holdings include the Grand Sierra 
Resort in Reno. The proceeds would be used to pay down 
the company’s debt to a level of $270 million. CEO Robert 
Griffin said TER would consider also selling the Trump Taj 
Mahal for the right price. 1291 However, in 2013, Carl Icahn, 
who held the mortgage on the Trump Casinos, would reject 
the sale of the Trump Plaza. 1301 

In early August 2014, Donald Trump filed a lawsuit de- 
manding removal of his name from the company’s two casi- 
nos, because they had allegedly been allowed to fall into 
disrepair, in breach of the licensing agreement for Trump’s 
name. 1 311 


2014 bankruptcy 

Trump Entertainment Resorts filed again for bankruptcy in 
September 2014. 1321 On a motion made by union UNITE 
HERE Local 54, relating to the bankruptcy action, the 
United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit ruled 
in Trump Entertainment’s favor on January 15, 2016 and 
held that Trump Entertainment could reject the continuing 
terms and conditions of a collective bargaining agreement 
with the union, an agreement that had already expired by its 
terms. This case is significant as it is a matter of first im- 
pression among the courts of appeal and could significantly 
alter the balance of power between debtor-employers and 
their unions. 1331 

The company exited bankruptcy in February 2016 and be- 
came a subsidiary of Icahn Enterprises. 1341 


6.2.2 Former properties 

Trump Entertainment Resorts’s only current property is the 

Trump Taj Mahal in Atlantic City, New Jersey. 

The company’s former properties include: 

• Harrah’s at Trump Plaza in Atlantic City, New Jer- 
sey (formerly a 50/50 partnership with Harrah’s) now 
wholly owned and renamed as the Trump Plaza, which 
was closed on September 16, 2014. 

• Trump 29 in Coachella, California (formerly a 50/50 
partnership with the Twenty-Nine Palms Band of Mis- 
sion Indians of California) now Spotlight 29 Casino. 

• Trump Casino in Gary, Indiana now the Majestic Star 
II. 

• Trump World’s Fair Casino at Trump Plaza in Atlantic 
City, New Jersey. Operated as a wing of Trump Plaza, 
but with its own casino license, it was closed in 1999, 
and demolished in 2000. 

• Trump Marina (previously Trump Castle) in Atlantic 
City, New Jersey now the second incarnation of the 
Golden Nugget Atlantic City brand. 

• Steel Pier, now owned by Steel Pier Associates.

6.4 Miss Universe 

Not to be confused with Mrs. Universe. 

Miss Universe is an annual international beauty pageant 
that is run by the Miss Universe Organization. 1 11 Along with 
its rival contests. Miss World and Miss Earth, this pageant is 
one of the most important and publicized beauty contests in 
the world. [2][3][4 ^ 5) The pageant was founded in 1952 by the 
California clothing company Pacific Mills, and is owned, 
along with Miss USA, by WME/IMG. [6] 

In 1998, Miss Universe, Inc. changed its name to Miss Uni- 
verse Organization, and moved its headquarters from Los 
Angeles to New York City. 171181 

In 1998, the logo of Miss Universe - “the woman with stars” 
- was created, 181 representing the beauty and responsibility 
of women around the world. 191 The same logo is used in 
present-day pageants. 181 

In 2015, after Donald Trump made statements about 
immigrants from Mexico in his presidential campaign kick- 
off speech, NBC decided to end their business relation- 
ship and stated that they will no longer air the pageant, or 
the Miss USA pageant, on their networks. 1101 In September 
2015, Trump bought the entire stock of the Miss Universe 
Organization from NBC, becoming its sole owner for three 
days until selling the entire stock to WME/IMG. [61 

The current Miss Universe is Pia Wurtzbach of the 
Philippines who was crowned on 20 December 2015 in Las 
Vegas, USA. [11] 

6.4.1 History 

The title “Miss Universe” was first used by the International 
Pageant of Pulchritude in 1926. This contest was held an- 
nually until 1935, when the Great Depression and other 
events preceding World War II led to its demise. 

Today’s Miss Universe Pageant was founded after Yolande 
Betbeze, the winner of the 1951 Miss America pageant, re- 
fused to pose in a swimsuit from its major sponsor, Catalina 
Swimwear. The brand’s manufacturer Pacific Mills with- 
drew its sponsorship from Miss America and set up the Miss 
USA and Miss Universe contests. The first Miss Universe 
Pageant was held in Long Beach, California in 1952. It was 
won by Armi Kuusela from Linland, who gave up her title, 
though not officially, to get married, shortly before her year 
was completed. 1121 Until 1958, the Miss Universe title, like 
that of Miss America, was dated by the year following the 
contest, so at the time Ms. Kuusela’s title was Miss Uni- 
verse 1953. 

Since its founding by Pacific Mills, the pageant has been 


organized and conducted by the Miss Universe Organiza- 
tion. Eventually Pacific Mills and its subsidiaries were ac- 
quired by the Kayser-Roth Corporation, which was in turn 
acquired by Gulf and Western Industries. Donald Trump 
acquired the pageant in 1996. 1131 

The pageant was first televised in 1955. CBS began 
broadcasting the combined Miss USA and Miss Universe 
pageants in 1960, and as separate contests in 1965. lohn 
Charles Daly hosted the pageant from 1955 to 1966, Bob 
Barker from 1967 to 1987, Alan Thicke in 1988, lohn 
Lorsythe in 1989, Dick Clark from 1990 to 1993, and 
Bob Goen from 1994 to 1996. In 2003, NBC outbid 
the other networks for the TV rights. [14] Prom 2003 to 

2014, the pageant was broadcast in the US on NBC. NBC 
and Univision dropped the pageant in 2015 due to com- 
ments made by presidential candidate Donald Trump about 
undocumented immigrants from Mexico. 1101 Starting in 

2015, Pox is the official broadcaster of the Miss Universe 
pageant. 1151 

6.4.2 Ownership 

Up until September 2015, the Miss Universe Organization 
was a joint venture between NBC and Donald Trump. The 
company has run the contest since 2002. [1J NBC cancelled 
all business relationships with the Miss Universe Organiza- 
tion and with Trump in response to his political comments 
about illegal immigration during his campaign for the pres- 
idency of the United States. [16 ^ In September 2015, Trump 
bought out NBC’s 50% stake in the organization making 
him the company’s sole owner, which he held for three days 
before selling the entire pageant to WME/IMG. 1 171 The cur- 
rent president of the Miss Universe Organization is Paula 
Shugart. [181 

6.4.3 Official song 

Miss Universe’s historical song, “You are my star”, was the 
official song for the pageant from 1987 to 1995. It was sung 
by the “Little Sisters”, a group of young children from the 
host country. 1191 

6.4.4 Competition formats 

During the early years of the pageant, the delegates who 
made the first cut were announced after the preliminary 
competition. Prom 1965 to the present day, the semifinal- 
ists were not announced until the night of the main event. 
The semifinalists once again competed in evening gown and 
swimsuit and five finalists were announced. An interview 
portion was introduced in 1960 to decide the runners-up 


76 


CHAPTER 6. BUSINESS CAREER 


and the winner. 

From 1959 to 1964 there were slight format changes. From 
1959 through 1963 there was no cut to reach the five final- 
ists. The runners-up and winner were called from the as- 
sembled 15 semifinalists. In 1965 the pageant returned to 
the original format of a cut to five finalists, and remained 
so until 1989. In 1969 a final question was posed to the 
last five contestants. The final question was an on-and-off 
feature of the pageant. In 1990 it had taken root, and with 
every pageant since the final contestants have had to answer 
a final question. In 1990 the pageant implemented major 
changes in the competition itself. Instead of five finalists, 
the field was reduced from ten semifinalists to six. Each 
contestant then randomly selected a judge and answered the 
question posed by the judge. After that, the field was nar- 
rowed down further to a final three. In 1998, the number of 
finalists was reduced to five, although there still was a cut to 
a final three. This continued until 2001, when the final five 
format was reinstated. 

In the year 2000, the interview portion of the semifinal was 
dropped, and the contestants competed only in swimsuits 
and evening gowns, as in the early years of the pageant. In 
2003, the number of semifinalists was increased to fifteen, 
with cuts made to ten, and then to five contestants. The final 
question varied, each coming from the final delegates them- 
selves and the current Miss Universe. In 2006, twenty semi- 
finalists were selected for the swimsuit competition, ten of 
whom went on to the evening gown competition. The five 
who passed that stage competed in an interview round, af- 
ter which the runners-up and winner were announced. The 
2007 contest followed a similar format, with fifteen con- 
testants competing in the swimsuit stage. In 201 1, for the 
first time, one of the sixteen semifinalists was selected ex- 
clusively by TV viewers via online voting. In the 2014 con- 
test held in January 2015, a final question was chosen from 
thousands submitted by Facebook. 1201 

In 2015, the contest followed a similar format from its pre- 
vious years. In the final 5, a contestant answered the ques- 
tion which is related to national issue of their country. Af- 
ter that, the field was narrowed down further to a final three 
who will then go on to answer one common question, the 
final Q and A. Finally, there will be a final vote based on 
overall impression and performance in the last round. For 
the first time, the rest of the contestants played the role of 
a final judge and had the chance to choose the new Miss 
Universe. 


Local organizations that wish to select the Miss Universe 
contestant for their countries must submit bids to the Miss 
Universe Organization for that right. Occasionally, the tra- 
ditional license holder for a particular country may lose its 
bid, as has happened in Italy, Denmark, France, Sweden, 
Germany, Great Britain, and more. 

Usually a country’s candidate selection involves pageants in 
major cities, whose winners compete in a national pageant, 
but there are exceptions. For example, from 2000 to 
2004, Australian delegates were chosen by a modeling 
agency. Although such “castings” are generally discouraged 
by the Miss Universe Organization, Miss Australia Jennifer 
Hawkins was chosen to be Miss Universe in 2004. When 
Australia resumed its national pageant, Michelle Guy be- 
came Miss Universe Australia 2005. 

Some of the most successful national pageants in the 
last decade have been Venezuela, USA, Puerto Rico, 
France, Philippines which command consistently high in- 
terest and television ratings in their respective countries. 121 1 
Recent arrivals in the pageant include Slovenia (2001), 
China and Albania (2002), Vietnam, Georgia and Ethiopia 
(2004), Latvia (2005), Kazakhstan (2006), Tanzania 
(2007), Kosovo (2008), Gabon and Lithuania (2012) along- 
side Azerbaijan (2013); there have also been efforts to 
revive strong national pageants in South Africa, Canada, 
Spain, Japan and Latin America (especially Venezuela, 
Puerto Rico, Mexico, Colombia, and Brazil). Prior power- 
houses are Finland, Germany and Sweden. England is the 
most successful nonwinning country with nine top-five po- 
sitions. The current powerhouses that often make the semi- 
finals are: USA, Philippines, Venezuela, Colombia, Brazil, 
Ukraine, France, and Australia. 

The organization makes continual efforts to expand the 
pageant, but the participation of some countries such as 
Algeria has proven difficult due to cultural barriers to 
the swimsuit competition, while others such as Armenia, 
Mozambique, and Nepal have balked at sending represen- 
tatives due to the cost. As of 2014, only four countries 
have been present at every Miss Universe since its incep- 
tion in 1952: Canada, France, Germany (East and West 
up to 1990), and the USA. Many European countries allow 
17 -year-old contestants to compete in their pageants, while 
Miss Universe’s minimum age is 18, so national titleholders 
often have to be replaced by their runners-up. Miss Uni- 
verse had previously prohibited transsexual applicants and 
age fabrication, but beginning in 2012, transgender women 
were allowed to compete, as long as they win their national 
pageants. 1221

6.4.6 Main pageant 


The main Miss Universe Pageant is held over a two-week 
period in December. In the 1970s through the 1990s, the 
pageant was a month long. This allowed time for rehearsals, 
appearances, and the preliminary competition, with the 
winner being crowned by the previous year’s titleholder dur- 
ing the final competition. 

According to the organizers, the Miss Universe contest is 
more than a beauty pageant: women aspiring to become 
Miss Universe must be intelligent, well-mannered, and cul- 
tured. Often a candidate has lost because she did not have a 
good answer during the question responses rounds; although 
this section of competition has held less importance during 
recent pageants than it did in the twentieth century. Dele- 
gates also participate in swimsuit and evening gown com- 
petitions. 

Currently, the final placement of the finalists is determined 
by a ranked vote, where each judge ranks each of the final 
three/five candidates, with the contestant posting the lowest 
cumulative score (thus often, but not necessarily always, the 
contestant with the most number one votes) becoming the 
winner. If there is a tie, the higher semifinal scores become 
decisive. 

The winner is assigned a one-year contract with the Miss 
Universe Organization, going overseas to spread messages 
about the control of diseases, peace, and public aware- 
ness of AIDS. Aside from the job, the winner also receives 
a cash allowance for her entire reign, a New York Film 
Academy scholarship, a modelling portfolio, beauty prod- 
ucts, clothes, shoes, as well as styling, healthcare, and fit- 
ness services by different sponsors of the pageant. When 
Donald Trump owned the pageant, the winner was given 
the use of a Trump Place apartment in New York City dur- 
ing her reign, which she shared with the Miss USA and Miss 
Teen USA titleholders. 12 ’ She also gains exclusive access to 
events such as fashion shows and opening galas, as well as 
access to casting calls and modelling opportunities through- 
out New York City. If the winner, for any reason, cannot 
fulfill her duties as Miss Universe, the 1st runner-up takes 
over. 

Aside from the main winner and her runners-up, special 
awards are also given to the winners of the best National 
Costume, Miss Photogenic, and Miss Congeniality. The 
Miss Congeniality award is chosen by the delegates them- 
selves. In recent years. Miss Photogenic has been chosen 
by popular internet vote (the winner used to be chosen by 
media personnel covering the event). 


Final judgment 

The competition for the Miss Universe title has seen 
many changes, although there have been several constants 
throughout its history. All the contestants compete in a pre- 
liminary round of judging (nowadays called the “Presenta- 
tion Show”) where the field is narrowed to a select num- 
ber of semifinalists. This number has fluctuated over the 
years. The first Miss Universe pageant had ten semifinal- 
ists. For the next two years, the number of semifinalists 
grew to 16. In 1955, the number dropped to a stable 15, 
which remained through 1970. In 1971, the number was 
reduced to 12. That number was further reduced to 10 in 
1984. This lasted until 2003, when the number of 15 was 
reinstated. In 2006, there were 20 semifinalists, the highest 
number ever. In 2007, the organization announced the Top 
15 system would be back, which was also used in 2008 until 
2010. In 201 1, the results of a fan vote was shown on the 
screen during the swimsuit and evening gown competitions, 
but this did not affect the final outcome of the competition. 
From 2011 to 2013, there were 16 semifinalists, 15 chosen 
by judges and one chosen through Internet votes. The 16th 
semifinalist by fan vote has been dropped as of 2015, and 
the number has been reverted back to 15 semifinalists. 

In the early years, the contestants were judged in swimsuit 
and evening gown only. In later years, the contestants also 
competed in a preliminary interview round in a one-on-one 
meeting with each individual judge. 

6.4.7 Crown 

In 2014 and 2015 , Paulina Vega and Pia Wurtzbach 1241 were 
decorated with a diamond crown 1251 estimated to be worth 
US$300,000, produced in the workshop of Czech company 
DIC - Diamonds International Corporation. The whole pro- 
duction process, from the first sketches to the production 
itself, took approximately four months. The shape of the 
crown is reminiscent of Manhattan skyline. Its production 
required the work of 10 people and the crown is made up of 
311 pcs of diamonds, 5 pieces of blue topaz, 198 pieces of 
blue sapphire, 33 pieces of crystal and 220 grams of gold. 
Total weight of the crown is 41 1 g. 

From 2009 - 2013 , Diamond Nexus Labs made the Miss 
Universe crown. The crown is set with 1,371 gemstones, 
weighing a total of 416.09 carats (83.218 g). It contains 
544.31 grams of 14k and 18k white gold as well as plat- 
inum. The crown features synthetic rubies to represent Miss 
Universe’s HIV/AIDS education and awareness platform. 
Diamond Nexus Labs is the first ever eco-friendly Official 
Jeweler of Miss Universe and was selected as part of NBC 
Universal’s “Green is Universal” initiative. 12611271 

The winner of the 2008 Miss Universe Pageant, which 


78 


CHAPTER 6. BUSINESS CAREER 


was broadcast from the Crown Convention Center in Nha 
Trang, Vietnam was crowned with the masterpiece which 
was designed by Rosalina Lydster of Jewelry by Rosalina 
and Ms. Dang Thi Kim Lien of CAO Fine Jewelry. The 
crown, valued at $120,000, is made of 18K white and yel- 
low gold. It is composed of over 1,000 precious stones; 
including 555 white diamonds (30 carats), 375 cognac dia- 
monds (14 carats), 10 smoky quartz crystals (20 carats) and 
19 morganite gemstones (60 carats). The colors of the jew- 
els chosen for the crown have great significance. The yellow 
luster of the gold represents the prosperous thriving econ- 
omy in Vietnam. White, light pink and cognac are the main 
hues in the crown which represent inspiration and feeling. 
Each piece of the crown was designed to represent an im- 
portant attribute of the Miss Universe Pageant. The curves 
of inlaid precious stones represent the strong development 
and potential of each country. The image of the crane (Lac 
Bird) symbolizes Vietnamese spirit and culture. The image 
of the heart represents unified breath, rhythm and vision, 
which are powerful internal forces that stress faith, hope 
and unity. 

The Miss Universe crown used from 2002-2007 was de- 
signed by Mikimoto, the official jewelry sponsor of the 
Miss Universe Organization, and depicted the phoenix ris- 
ing, signifying status, power and beauty. The crown has 
500 diamonds of almost 30 carats (6.0 g), 120 South Sea 
and Akoya pearls, ranging in size from 3 to 18 mm diam- 
eter and is valued at $250,000. The Crown was designed 
for the pageant on Mikimoto Pearl Island in Japan with the 
Mikimoto crown and tiara being first used for Miss Uni- 
verse 2002. [28]

6.5 Miss USA 

Not to be confused with Miss America, Miss World 
America, Miss U.S. International, or Miss Earth United 
States. 

The Miss USA beauty pageant has been held annually since 
1952 to select the American entrant in the Miss Universe 
pageant. The Miss Universe Organization operates both 
pageants, as well as Miss Teen USA. 

The pageant was owned by Donald Trump from 1996 to 
2015, and was previously broadcast on NBC. In 2015, after 
Trump made statements about undocumented immigrants 
from Mexico in his presidential campaign kickoff speech, 
NBC decided to end their business relationship and stated 
that they will no longer air the pageant, or the Miss Uni- 
verse pageant, on their networks. 111 In September 2015, 
WME/IMG purchased the pageant from Trump. 121 

The current Miss USA is Olivia Jordan of Oklahoma who 
was crowned on July 12, 2015 in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. 
Traditionally, Miss USA lives in New York City during her 
reign. 

6.5.1 History 

The Miss USA pageant was conceived in 1950 when 
Yolande Betbeze, winner of the rival Miss America 
pageant, refused to pose for publicity pictures while wear- 
ing a swimsuit. Pageant sponsor Catalina decided to pull 
their sponsorship off the pageant and create their own 
competition. 13 ' Other owners have included a subsidiary of 
Gulf+Western Industries, ITT Corporation, and billionaire 
Donald Trump. [4][5] 

The first Miss USA and Miss Universe pageants were held 
concurrently in Long Beach, California in 1952; the first 
Miss USA winner was Miss New York USA Jackie Lough- 
ery. 161 There were thirty delegates in the first year of com- 
petition, and many states did not compete every year dur- 
ing the first two decades of the pageant’s history. From the 
1970s, each state and the District of Columbia have sent 
a delegate each year. Alaska first competed in 1959 and 
Hawaii in 1960. Both had competed at Miss Universe until 
this time. 

The pageant aired on CBS from 1963 until 2002, and for 
many years was known for having a CBS game show host 
as pageant host. John Charles Daly hosted the show from

CHAPTER 6. BUSINESS CAREER 


1963-1966, Bob Barker from 1967 (He wasn't a regular 
for the CBS network until 1972 when he became host of 
The Price Is Right which he hosted until 2007) until 1987 
(at which point he quit in a dispute over fur coats), Alan 
Thicke in 1988, Dick Clark from 1989-1993, and Bob 
Goen from 1994—1996. The show’s highest ratings were 
in the early 1980s, when it regularly topped the Nielsen 
ratings. 171181191 Viewership dropped sharply from the 1990s 
to the 2000s, from an estimated viewership of 20 million 
to an average of 7 million from 2000-2001. 1101 In 2002, 
owner Donald Trump brokered a new deal with NBC, giv- 
ing them half -ownership of the Miss USA, Miss Universe 
and Miss Teen USA and moving them to NBC on an ini- 
tial five-year contract. 1 " 1 The pageants were first shown on 
NBC in 2003. 

Historically, the winner of the Miss USA title represented 
the U.S. in its sister pageant Miss Universe. Since its in- 
ception, eight Miss USA titleholders have gone on to win 
Miss Universe. In the mid-1960s, the organization estab- 
lished a rule that when a Miss USA wins the Miss Universe 
title, the first runner-up assumes the Miss USA title for the 
remainder of the year. This occurred in 1980, 1995,1997, 
and 2012. 112,1131 In 1967, the first runner-up Susan Bradley 
of California declined the title and the crown went to the 
second runner-up Cheryl Patton of Florida. The only in- 
stance when a first runner-up assumed the title of Miss 
USA prior to this period was in 1957, when Mary Leona 
Gage of Maryland resigned after it was discovered she was 
married. 1141 

See also: Miss USA 2015 § Controversy 

In late-June 2015, both NBC and Spanish-language net- 
work Univision announced that they would cut their ties 
with Donald Trump and the Miss Universe Organization 
in response to derogatory remarks Trump made relating to 
illegal immigration during the launch of his 2016 U.S. pres- 
idential campaign, resulting in both Miss USA and Miss 
Universe being dropped from their schedules. NBCUniver- 
sal also plans to take steps to remove itself from the MUO 
joint venture. Trump threatened to sue both companies 
over the decision; on June 30, 2015, Trump sued Univision 
for defamation and breach of contract. 11511161 As a result. 
Miss USA 2015 will instead be carried via a webcast on 
the pageant’s website. 1171 On July 1, digital cable network 
Reelz announced they would televise the 2015 pageant. 1181 
Starting 2016, Fox will broadcast the pageant. 1191 

6.5.2 Competition 

The modern pageant consists of a preliminary competition 
held a week before the pageant when all contestants are 
judged in swimsuit, gown, and interview competitions. 1201 


From this, semifinalists are chosen, and they are announced 
during the live broadcast of the final competition. These 
semifinalists then compete in swimsuit and evening gown, 
and the finalists are chosen. These finalists then proceed to 
the final question portion of the competition. The runners- 
up and winner are announced at the end of the telecast. 
Since 1997, different panels of judges have officiated the 
finals and the Preliminary competition. 

From 1975-2000, all delegates who made the initial cut 
competed in an interview competition in some format, of- 
ten involving all semi-finalists. As of 2001, this interview 
portion was taken away, leaving only the final question for 
the top five delegates to answer. 

From 1979-2002, the average scores of each delegate were 
shown on the television broadcast; thus the semi-finalists 
could be ranked. This was changed in 2003 to a “circle” sys- 
tem, wherein judges choose a certain number of delegates 
to “circle”, and those with the most “circles” make the cut. 
This system was used prior to the computer scoring system 
implemented in 1979. In 2007, the circle system was rein- 
stated and contestants’ composite scores were shown live. 


6.5.3 State competitions 

Every year, each state holds a preliminary competition to 
choose their delegate for the Miss USA pageant. In some 
states (such as Texas and Florida), local pageants are also 
held to determine delegates for the state competition. The 
state winners hold the title “Miss State USA” for the year 
of their reign. 

The most successful state is Texas, which has had the most 
semi-finalists and winners, including five consecutive Miss 
USA titleholders during the 1980s. 1211 Other successful 
states include California, New York, Alabama, Tennessee 
and Georgia. The least successful states are Delaware, plac- 
ing only once in 2015; Montana, which has not placed since 
the 1950s; South Dakota, which has only placed twice (the 
last time in 1974), and Wyoming, which gained only its sec- 
ond placement in 2010. The only state which has produced 
more than one Miss Universe is South Carolina. 

The Miss Universe Organization licenses out the state 
pageants to pageant directors, who in some cases are re- 
sponsible for more than one state. The most well established 
directorial groups are RPM Productions, created in 1980 
(Alabama, Louisiana, North Carolina, South Carolina), and 
Vanbros, created in the early 1990s (Arkansas, Kansas, 
Missouri, Nebraska and Oklahoma). Future Productions 
direct the most states, seven, across the Midwest and Rock- 
ies.

By number of wins 



6.5.5 Awards 

The awards most frequently presented at Miss USA are 
Miss Amity (also known as Miss Congeniality) and Miss 
Photogenic. 

The Miss Amity Award is chosen by the delegates, and rec- 
ognizes those who are the friendliest and make the pageant 
experience the most enjoyable. In 1952 to 1964 when 
the Miss USA and Miss Universe pageants were concur- 
rent events, the award could be won by a contestant com- 
peting either for Miss USA or Miss Universe. In fact, 
in 1960, there was a tie, with the award going to Miss 
Myanmar, Myint Myint May, and Miss Louisiana USA, 
Rebecca Fletcher. In 2015, Alaska and Delaware tied for 
the Miss Congeniality award. Vermont has won five Miss 
Amity/Congeniality awards, two more than any other state. 

The Miss Photogenic prize was first awarded in 1965 and 
was chosen by journalists until 1996 when it was chosen by 
an internet vote for the first time. There has been only one 
tie in this award’s history: in 1980 when it was shared be- 
tween Jineane Ford of Arizona and Elizabeth Kim Thomas 
of Ohio. The state that has won the most Photogenic awards 
is Virginia. 

Louisiana won both the first Miss Amity and Photogenic 
awards given to a Miss USA contestant. 

Other awards that have been presented include Best State 
Costume (1962-1993), Style (1995-2001) and Most Beau- 
tifulEyes (1993). In 1998, a special Distinguished Achieve- 
ment award was given to Halle Berry. 1241 Berry was Miss 
Ohio USA 1986 and placed 1st runner-up to Christy Ficht- 
ner of Texas. She later went on to become an acclaimed 
actress and Oscar winner.

6.6 Miss Teen USA 

Miss Teen USA is a beauty pageant run by the Miss Uni- 
verse Organization for girls aged 14—19. The reigning ti- 
tleholder is Katherine Haik of Louisiana. Unlike its sister 
pageants Miss Universe and Miss USA which are broad- 
cast on Fox this pageant is webcast on the Miss Teen USA 
website and simulcast on Microsoft's Xbox Live service. 

The pageant was first held in 1983 and has been broadcast 
live on CBS until 2002 and then on NBC from 2003-2007. 
In March 2007 it was announced that the broadcast of the 
Miss Teen USA pageant on NBC had not been renewed, 
and that Miss Teen USA 2007 would be the final televised 
event. 111 

Since 2008, the pageant is held at the Atlantis Paradise Is- 
land Resort, located in Nassau, Bahamas. 

Notable pageant winners include actresses Kelly Hu (1985, 
Hawaii), Bridgette Wilson (1990, Oregon), Charlotte 
Lopez-Ayanna (1993, Vermont), Vanessa Minnillo (1998, 
South Carolina), Shelley Hennig (2004, Louisiana), and 
sportscaster Allie LaForce (2005, Ohio). 


6.6.1 History 

The following is a list of pageant editions and informa- 
tion. 


6.6.2 Competition rounds 

Prior to the final telecast the delegates compete in the 
preliminary competition, which involves private interviews 
with the judges and a presentation show where they com- 
pete in swimsuit and evening gown. 

During the final competition, the semi-finalists are an- 
nounced and go on to compete in swimsuit and evening 
gown. From 1983 to 2002 all semi-finalists also competed 
in an interview competition as well as both swimsuit and 
evening gown, followed by one or two final interview ques- 
tions. In 2003, a new format was introduced where the top 
fifteen competed in evening gown, the top ten competed in 
swimsuit and the top live competed in the final question. 
In 2006, the order of competition was changed where the 
top fifteen competed in swimsuit and the top ten in evening 
gown. The latest competition format was used since 2008 
the final not broadcast on TV, where the top fifteen both 
competed in swimsuit and evening gown, and the top five 
competed in the final question who all signed up by a panel 
of judges.

6.6.4 Broadcasting of the pageant 

1983-2007: Viewership and later decline 

The pageant’s viewership peak was hit in 1988, when the 
pageant averaged over 22 million viewers on CBS. Even as 
recently as 1999, the show managed to bring in over 10 mil- 
lion viewers. The 2006 airing was the second lowest rated 
in the pageant’s 23-year history, with only 5.6 million view- 
ers watching the live broadcast (the lowest: 2004, with 5.34

million). 121 The 2007 telecast (25th Anniversary, scheduled 
for August 24, 2007) was the last time Miss Teen USA aired 
live on television. 

2008: Dark pageant 

The 2008 pageant was held, untelevised, on August 16, 
2008. One factor that prevented NBC from broadcast- 
ing was its prime time commitment to the 2008 Summer 
Olympics in Beijing. 

2009-present: Internet pageant 

Since 2009, it is broadcast over the Internet on the Miss 
Teen USA website. It can be viewed worldwide, with- 
out any region restrictions via geolocation. Currently, it is 
hosted by YouTube. 

In 2012, the pageant began to simulcast in selected regions 
on Microsoft’s Xbox Live service, expanding accessibility 
to Xbox consoles and Windows devices. 

6.6.5 Crossovers with Miss USA 

Miss Teen USA at Miss USA 

In the early years of Miss Teen USA, three winners rep- 
resented the title “Miss Teen USA” at Miss USA. The 
three queens were: Ruth Zakarian (1983), Cherise Haugen 
(1984), and Allison Brown (1986). This also made history 
because the Miss USA 1984 pageant had 53 delegates, the 
most ever in a Miss USA pageant. In 1987, Miss Teen USA 
1986, Allison Brown participated in the 1987 Miss USA 
pageant. All three failed to make the cut at their respective 
Miss USA pageants. 

Only in the three years mentioned above did Miss Teen 
USA winners automatically gain representation at Miss 
USA. Starting in 1988, if the Miss Teen USA winners want 
to compete at Miss USA, they first must win a Miss USA 
state crown. A total of seven Miss Teen USA winners have 
participated at Miss USA, with four winning their state Miss 
USA crowns first. The first of these was Kelly Hu, Miss 
Teen USA 1985, who won the Miss Hawaii USA 1993 title 
and represented Hawaii at Miss USA 1993. She finished 
as a finalist. The next was Jamie Solinger, Miss Teen USA 
1992. She took the Miss Iowa USA 1998 title but failed to 
make the cut at the Miss USA pageant. Only two Miss Teen 
USA winners have made the top 3 of Miss USA. Brandi 
Sherwood, Miss Teen USA 1989 won the Miss Idaho USA 
1997 title. Succeeding Kelly, she took 1st runner up and 
later inherited the Miss USA crown, when Brook Mahealani 
Lee of Hawaii won Miss Universe 1997. She is the only 



Miss Teen USA 1985 Kelly Hu became a model and a TV and film 
actress.

officially. 

There have been two years when two Miss Teen USA win- 
ners participated at Miss USA. The first was 1984, when 
Miss Teen USA 1983 and Miss Teen USA 1984 partici- 
pated, the second was 1998, when Jamie Solinger competed 
as Miss Iowa USA but went unplaced, and Shauna Gambill 
competed as Miss California USA and placed first runner- 
up. 

The first Miss Teen USA not to win a Miss USA state 
pageant on her first attempt was Christie Lee Woods, Miss 
Teen USA 1996, of Texas, who placed third runner-up in 
the Miss Texas USA 2002 pageant. She would also become 
the first Miss Teen USA to compete for, but never win a 
Miss USA state title (she also placed as a semi-finalist in 
2003 and 2004). The second Miss Teen USA who did not 
win a Miss USA state title on her first attempt was Ashley 
Coleman, Miss Teen USA 1999, of Delaware, who com- 
peted in the Miss California USA 2006 pageant and fin- 
ished third runner-up. She is the first Miss Teen USA win- 
ner to compete in a different state from that where she won 
her Miss Teen USA crown. Tami Farrell, Miss Teen USA 
2003, competed at Miss California USA 2009 as Miss Mal- 
ibu USA, but failed to win the crown, placing first runner-up 
to Carrie Prejean. Farrell competed at Miss Teen USA as 
Miss Oregon Teen USA, and was one of the few Miss Teen 
USA winners to try for the state crown outside of the state 
she represented for Miss Teen USA. In a span of only two 
years later. Miss Teen USA 2006, Katie Blair also com- 
peted at Miss California USA 2011. Representing the state 
of Montana at Miss Teen USA 2006, Blair is only the third 
Miss Teen USA to compete in a state other than the state 
she competed in Teen. Similarly to Coleman and Farrell, 

Blair placed 1st runner up in the pageant, to Alyssa Cam- 
panella, who also competed in Miss Teen USA representing 
another state. Campanella went on to win Miss USA 2011.

Political Career 


7.1 Donald Trump presidential cam- 
paign, 2000 

The Donald duck presidential campaign of 2000 for the 

nomination of the Reform Party began when real estate 
magnate Donald Trump of New York announced the cre- 
ation of a presidential exploratory committee on the Oc- 
tober 7, 1999 edition of Larry King Live. Though Trump 
had never held elected office, he was well known for his 
frequent comments on public affairs and business exploits 
as head of The Trump Organization. He had previously 
considered a presidential run in 1988 as a Republican, but 
chose not to run. For 2000, Minnesota Governor Jesse 
Ventura convinced Trump to seek the presidential nomi- 
nation of the Reform Party, which was fracturing despite 
achieving ballot access and qualifying for matching funds 
as a result of the presidential campaign of industrialist Ross 
Perot, the party’s 1996 presidential nominee. Trump’s 
entrance into the Reform Party race coincided with that 
of paleoconservative commentator Pat Buchanan, whom 
Trump attacked throughout the campaign as a "Hitler- 
lover.” 

Trump focused his campaign on the issues of fair trade, 
eliminating the national debt, and achieving universal 
healthcare as outlined in the campaign companion piece 
The America We Deserve, released in January 2000. He 
named media proprietor Oprah Winfrey as his ideal running 
mate and said he would instantly marry his girlfriend 
Melania Knauss to make her First Lady. Critics ques- 
tioned the seriousness of Trump’s campaign and specu- 
lated that it was a tactic to strengthen his brand and sell 
books. Trump defended his candidacy as a serious en- 
deavor and proclaimed that he had a chance to win the elec- 
tion. Though he never expanded the campaign beyond the 
exploratory phase. Trump made numerous media appear- 
ances as a candidate, traveled to campaign events in Florida, 
California, and Minnesota, and qualified for two presiden- 
tial primaries. Veteran campaign strategist and longtime 
Trump aide Roger Stone was hired as director of the ex- 
ploratory committee. 


Internal conflict caused Ventura to exit the Reform Party in 
February 2000, removing Trump’s most vocal proponent. 
Trump officially ended his campaign on the February 14, 
2000 airing of The Today Show. Though he believed he 
could still win the Reform Party presidential nomination, he 
felt the party was too dysfunctional to support his campaign 
and enable a win in the general election. A poll matching 
Trump against likely Republican nominee George W. Bush 
and likely Democratic nominee A1 Gore showed Trump 
with seven percent support. Despite his withdrawal. Trump 
won both primaries for which he qualified. Buchanan would 
go on to win the nomination. 

After the election. Trump gained even greater notoriety as 
the host of The Apprentice. He seriously considered run- 
ning as a Republican in the 2012 presidential election but 
decided against it. Four years later he initiated a full-scale 
presidential campaign and became the front-runner for the 
Republican Party’s 2016 presidential nomination. 

7.1.1 Background 

Real estate magnate Donald Trump, head of The Trump 
Organization since 1971, first dabbled in presidential pol- 
itics in the early summer of 1987. Republican politi- 
cal organizer Mike Dunbar, unimpressed with the can- 
didates for the 1988 Republican presidential nomination, 
founded the “Draft Trump for President” organization. Be- 
lieving Trump had the makings of a president, Dunbar 
pitched Trump the idea of speaking at an event for Re- 
publican candidates in the first-in-the -nation primary state 
of New Hampshire. According to Dunbar in a later inter- 
view, Trump was receptive to this idea. 111 Then a registered 
Democrat, Trump officially changed his registration to Re- 
publican in July 1987. 121 Speculation that he would actu- 
ally run for president intensified two months later, 131 when 
he purchased $94,801 worth of full-page advertisements in 
the The New York Times, Boston Globe, and The Washington 
Post with the heading “There’s nothing wrong with Amer- 
ica’s Foreign Defense Policy that a little backbone can’t 
cure.” The advertisements reflected Trump’s concerns that

Donald Trump first considered running for president in 1987. 


Japan, Saudi Arabia, and Kuwait were taking advantage of 
American money and protection without providing any ben- 
efit to the United States. 141 The next month, as Dunbar had 
proposed. Trump appeared at a Rotary Club luncheon in 
New Hampshire. There, he delivered what The New York 
Times described as an “impassioned speech,” in which he 
expressed concern about the United States being “pushed 
around” by its allies and proposed that “these countries that 
are ripping us off pay off the $200 billion deficit.” In the 
audience, college students held placards reading “Trump 
for President.” Nevertheless, Trump proclaimed, “I'm not 
here because I'm running for President. I'm here because 
I'm tired of our country being kicked around and I want to 
get my ideas across. Later, Trump appeared on the Phil 
Donahue Show. After the appearance, he received a letter 
from former President Richard Nixon in which Nixon ex- 
plained that his wife Pat, “an expert on politics,” had seen 
Trump on Donahue and “predicts that whenever you de- 
cide to run for office you will be a winner!" 161 In November 
1987, Trump released The Art of the Deal, which became 
a. New York Times bestseller. 171 

Months later, during an April 1988 appearance on The 
Oprah Winfrey Show}* 1, Trump discussed his displeasure 
with the United States’ status as a “debtor nation” and its 
seeming inability to compete with Japan. Winfrey asked 


Trump if he would ever run for president. He replied, 
“Probably not, but I do get tired of seeing the country get 
ripped off . . . I just don't think I have the inclination to do it.” 
Furthermore, he asserted that if he ever did run, he would 
win the election. 191 He later appeared at the 1988 Repub- 
lican National Convention. In an interview on the floor, 
NBC News reporter Chris Wallace asked whether Trump’s 
visit to his first national convention would induce him to 
“take the plunge” into a presidential campaign. In response. 
Trump downplayed his earlier foray, though repeated that 
he would win if he ever ran, and praised then-presumptive 
Republican presidential nominee George H. W. Bush. 1101 
During another convention interview on Larry King Live , 
Trump dismissed the speculation that he had considered 
running for president and commented, “I doubt I’ll ever be 
involved in politics beyond what I do right now.” 1 ’ Talk of 
a potential Trump candidacy grew silent for much of the 
next decade. 

In 1995, industrialist Ross Perot, who had received 18.9 
percent of the vote during his Independent 1992 run for 
president formed the Reform Party of the United States of 
America 1 1 1 1 Though Perot won the party’s 1996 nomination 
and garnered 8.4 percent of the popular vote, rifts had be- 
gun forming within the party. Former Colorado Governor 
Richard Lamm, who unsuccessfully challenged Perot for 
the 1996 presidential nomination, accused Perot of using 
the party as a personal vehicle, and broke off with his sup- 
porters to form a new party. 1 121 In 1998, former professional 
wrestler Jesse Ventura was elected Governor of Minnesota 
as a member of the Reform Party — the party’s most signif- 
icant victory — but Perot and his followers were not recep- 
tive to Ventura and his political allies. 1131 The Perot-faction 
adamantly, though unsuccessfully, attempted to prevent the 
election of Ventura supporter Jack Gargan as party chair- 
man in 1999 when Perot backer Russ Verney chose not to 
stand for re-election for his term ending January 1, 2000. 1141 
Opting not to run for president himself in 2000, 1 131 Ven- 
tura searched for candidates. I15] Initially, he courted WWF 
Board Member and former Connecticut governor Lowell 
P. Weicker, Jr.. He then turned to friend and wrestling afi- 
cionado Donald Trump. 

7.1.2 Early stages 

The New York Times reported that Jesse Ventura first ap- 
proached Trump about a possible 2000 presidential run 
while both were in attendance at a wrestling event in 
Atlantic City. 1161 Trump’s ambitions may have spawned ear- 
lier. The America We Deserve co-writer Dave Shiflett said 
Trump first thought about running in late 1998, when he 
looked at his political advantages in money and name recog- 
nition and concluded that he was “at least as competent” as 
then President Bill Clinton. 1171 According to Shiflett, this

CHAPTER 7. POLITICAL CAREER 


prompted Trump to ask top aide Roger Stone to find the 
“most eminent hack writer in America” to put Trump’s po- 
litical ideas into a book. Stone reached out to Shiflett, a con- 
tributor to The American Spectator. In Spring 1999, Shiflett 
met with Trump about the project that would later become 
The America We Deserve. During the initial meeting, Shi- 
flett claims Trump raised concerns about a suitcase bomb 
destroying Manhattan. 1171 



Minnesota Governor Jesse Ventura privately encouraged Trump to 
run. 

In July 1999, the Democratic 1181 polling firm Schroth and 
Associates conducted a poll of 400 Reform Party leaders 1191 
and found Trump tied for third place for the Reform Party 
presidential nomination. 1181 Both the Reform Party and 
Trump denied having commissioned the poll. 1191 Days later 
Newsweek raised speculation 1191 when it cited an unnamed 
“close friend” of Trump who said Trump was “toying” with 
the idea of a presidential campaign, allegedly in response to 
rumors of Ventura’s courting of Weicker for a run. Trump 
purportedly held a grudge against Weicker for blocking his 
plans to build a casino in Bridgeport 1201 in 1994. The two 
had an exchange of insults in which Weicker labeled Trump 
a “dirt bag” and Trump referred to Weicker as “a fat slob 
who couldn't get elected dog catcher.” 1181 In response to 
the Newsweek report. Trump sent out a press release in 
which he criticized the two party system, praised the Re- 
form Party, and stated “If the Reform Party nominated 
me, I would probably run and probably win.” However, he 
added that if the party nominated him he would ask for “an 
immediate recount.” 1181 In an interview, he told The New 
York Times , “I'm honored and I'm flattered [by the specula- 
tion], but the fact is I've never had more fun than I'm having 
right now, building the most spectacular buildings in New 
York.” 1181 Chairman Verney denied that the Reform Party 
had any interest in Trump, explaining that party members 
had “never spent one second thinking about him.” 1191 A 
CNN-77we poll conducted later in July showed Trump with 


seven percent support nationally in a match up against Re- 
publican candidate George W. Bush and Vice President A1 
Gore. 1211 

Two months later, amid reports that paleoconservative po- 
litical commentator and adviser Pat Buchanan was about 
to join the Reform Party to seek the nomination. Trump 
announced that he would consider running as a sign of re- 
spect for Ventura. He labeled the views of Buchanan as 
“prehistoric”, 1221 and commented that even though he liked 
Pat, “I'm on the conservative side, but Buchanan is Attila 
the Hun.” 1231 He expected that a primary battle between the 
two would be “nasty.” 1241 According to columnist Robert 
Novak, Bush operatives concerned about a third party run 
by Buchanan contacted Ventura indirectly about preventing 
Buchanan’s nomination. Novak argued that Trump “seems 
a bad match with Perot’s party, but he may be the GOP’s last 
hope to stop Buchanan.” 1251 When Weicker decided not to 
seek the party’s nomination due to internal bickering, Ven- 
tura reportedly went all in for Trump. 1261 The media capi- 
talized on a potential Trump versus Buchanan challenge, 1241 
and Saturday Night Live satirized it with a skit in which 
Darrell Hammond portraying Trump and Chris Parnell as 
Buchanan pitched their candidacies to Ross Perot played by 
Cheri Oteri. The segment also featured an appearance by 
Will Ferrell as Ventura. 12711281 

Trump further increased speculation of a full-scale cam- 
paign when his publisher Renaissance Books announced a 
January 2000 release date for The American We Deserve. 
The publisher’s press release announced a book tour and 
teased, “Donald Trump for President? Run or not, Donald 
Trump’s ideas will have a major impact on the next presi- 
dential election.” 1291 Trump set January also as the month 
on which he would decide whether to run. He expressed, 
“I’m not interested in being the [third-party] candidate who 
gets the most votes in the history of the world outside of 
the Democratic and Republican parties, I would only con- 
sider this if I thought I could win.” 1301 On September 30, 
Trump wrote an opinion piece in the Wall Street Journal 
titled, “America Needs a President Like Me” in which he 
argued that he would be “the kind of president America 
needs in the new millennium.” He cited the “repugnant” 
comments of Buchanan and Ventura’s personal encourage- 
ment as factors contributing to his decision. 1311 In an Octo- 
ber 6 interview on Dateline NBC , Trump affirmed that he 
was “very serious” about his run. 1321 


7.1.3 Announcement 

On October 7, Trump announced on Larry King Live that 
he formed an exploratory committee to explore a Reform 
Party presidential bid. Trump planned not to use the 
committee to raise money — he would personally fund his

Melania Knauss was touted as Trump’s potential First Lady. 


campaign — but wished use the committee to advise him on 
political matters in preparation for a run. In the interview 
with Larry King, Trump was optimistic about his chances 
indicating a “very strong possibility” of victory. 1331 He ref- 
erenced a non-scientific National Enquirer poll of 100 indi- 
viduals, showing him in first place against his Democratic 
and Republican counterparts. 1211 When pressed. Trump 
identified Oprah Winfrey as his ideal choice for a running 
mate, 1341 describing her as “somebody that is very special,” 
and that if she agreed to run, “she'd be fantastic . . . 
she’s popular, she’s brilliant, she’s a wonderful woman.” 1351 
Oprah’s spokesperson later responded “at this point in time . 
. . Oprah is not running.” 1361 Trump labeled Rudy Giuliani 
as New York City’s greatest Mayor and spoke admirably of 
Presidents Dwight Eisenhower and Ronald Reagan, saying 
that Reagan had a demeanor that contributed to a phenom- 
enal spirit in the nation. Trump argued that President Bill 
Clinton could have been a great president, but destroyed his 
legacy with the Lewinsky scandal. As for the Reform Party, 
Trump offered praise for both Perot and Ventura, and at- 
tacked potential primary opponent Buchanan as someone 
“enamored” with Adolf Hitler, based on Buchanan’s thesis 
that Hitler presented no military threat to the United States 
ahead of World War II. 1351 

On the issues. Trump labeled himself “very conservative,” 
but described his views on healthcare as “quite liberal” 
and “getting much more liberal,” explaining “I believe in 
universal health care. I believe in whatever it takes to make 
people well and better .... [I]t’s an entitlement to this 
country if we're going to have a great country.” He ex- 
pressed opposition to NAFTA, gun control, and said he 
would like to see alcohol corporations sued in the same 
manner as tobacco corporations. For his first presidential 
term, he proclaimed, “I want to do the right job: straighten 
out Social Security, get the trade deficits in order, and lower 
taxes.” 1351 As for the lack of a first lady. Trump said he 


could solve the issue “in 24 hours” by marrying his 26 year 
old model girlfriend Melania Knauss. In a later interview, 
Knauss said she would marry Trump under such notice. 1371 
In the role, she said, “I would be very traditional. Like Betty 
Ford or Jackie Kennedy. I would support him.” 138 Trump 
described Knauss as “a woman of great style and elegance 
. . . very poised and gracious and able to get along with 
everyone.” 1371 

After the announcement. Trump and Knauss had dinner 
with Ventura and were joined by actor Woody Harrel- 
son. 1361 Ventura later commented that Trump’s chances 
of success depended on his impression of the Reform 
Party. 121 1 Onlookers questioned Trump’s motive in running. 
Democratic pollster Harrison Hickman expressed doubts 
about the authenticity of Trump’s campaign, saying “It’s all 
marketing of his name.” 1361 Matt Bai of Newsweek com- 
mented “Most serious-minded people think Trump’s flir- 
tation with the Reform Party’s presidential nomination is 
just a publicity stunt.” 1391 Ex-wife Ivana Trump doubted 
he would actually run. 1401 Former New York City Mayor 
Ed Koch commented that people would likely not flock 
to Trump’s campaign, suggesting that Trump was mer- 
chandising his brand. 1411 Trump disagreed with the crit- 
ics, arguing that even though his sales had increased as 
a result of media coverage, he was serious about the 
campaign. 1391 Roger Stone was hired as director of the ex- 
ploratory committee. 1421 


7.1.4 Primary campaign 

October 1999 

Trump’s announcement made way for the anticipated 
Buchanan-Trump primary contest with Buchanan himself 
moving closer to mounting a Reform Party bid. Buchanan 
announced he would decide whether to join the race by late 
October. A Schroth and Associates poll of 500 people who 
voted for Perot in 1996, showed Buchanan with a slight 
edge over Trump, 32 percent to 29 percent. 141 1 Though Ven- 
tura wished to prevent a Buchanan nomination, he did not 
publicly endorse Trump. Some of Ventura’s advisers were 
skeptical of Trump’s campaign and wanted Ventura to leave 
the party if a Buchanan nomination appeared imminent. 1391 
Ventura’s place in the party had become a subject of contro- 
versy. Chairman Verney asked Ventura to leave the party 
in early October after Ventura commented in a Playboy in- 
terview that “organized religion is a sham and a crutch.” 1431 
Perot also decided not to make an endorsement during the 
primary campaign, despite Buchanan’s plea that Perot pub- 
licly support his entrance into the race. 1411 

Before Trump could venture out on the campaign trail, he 
had to tend to some personal matters. In an interview with

CHAPTER 7. POLITICAL CAREER 



Pat Buchanan, Trump’s main rival for the Reform Party nomina- 
tion 

The Daily Telegraph , Marla Maples, Trump’s second ex- 
wife, threatened to reveal what Trump “is really like” if he 
chose to run for president in the general election. In re- 
sponse, Trump withheld $1.5 million in alimony he owed 
Maples, claiming she was in violation of the confidentiality 
agreement in the couple’s divorce decree. After a Man- 
hattan judge refused to hear the matter, a brief conference 
was held, wherein the judge’s law secretary advised Trump 
to pay the alimony and advised Maples that further inci- 
dents would be cause for the judge to reconsider hearing the 
matter. 144 ' Trump’s attorneys were satisfied that the meet- 
ing would cause Maples to rethink making any public state- 
ments on her marriage to Trump.' 45 ' 

On October 24, Trump appeared on Meet the Press , where 
he announced that he would officially join the Reform 
Party. During the interview. Trump questioned why a 
politician was better suited to be president than him, com- 
menting “I understand this stuff.” He said that the Republi- 
can Party has become “too crazy right.” Notably, he identi- 
fied Buchanan as a “Hitler-lover” and mused, “I guess he’s 
an anti-Semite ... He doesn't like the blacks, he doesn't 
like the gays. It’s just incredible that anybody could em- 
brace this guy.”' 46 ' As for his reputation as a womanizer. 
Trump said he would not run if he believed it would be 


an impediment.' 461 The next day. Trump formally joined 
the Reform Party, changing his voter registration from Re- 
publican to Independence Party, the New York affiliate of 
the Reform Party. On the same day, Buchanan announced 
that he too would leave the Republican Party to join with 
the Reform Party and attempt to obtain its presidential 
nomination. 1471 Buchanan said he refused to engage in a 
“name-calling” contest with Trump but made a thinly veiled 
attack against Trump’s wealth, arguing, “I don't believe the 
Reform Party nomination can be bought, and I don't be- 
lieve the Presidency can be bought.”' 46 ' On Face the Na- 
tion , Pat Choate, the Reform Party’s 1996 vice presidential 
nominee said Trump would “make a good candidate,” but 
argued that Buchanan could challenge Trump “on the mer- 
its” and that Trump and the media were misrepresenting 
Buchanan’s views through “hate politics.” Other party mem- 
bers expressed reservations about Trump’s comments and 
personal life.' 46 " 48 ' Verney wondered “what the compelling 
reason is for him to seek the presidency.”' 49 ' Trump ac- 
knowledged himself as “certainly controversial” but labeled 
himself as “a great businessman,” who would “make the 
greatest treaties that this country’s seen in a long time.”' 50 ' 
On Fox News Sunday he criticized U.S. Trade Representa- 
tive Charlene Barshefsky and said that as president he him- 
self would fill the position and negotiate trade deals with 
other countries. He identified France, Japan, Germany, and 
Saudi Arabia as nations taking advantage of badly negoti- 
ated trade deals with the United States. 151 ' 


November 1999 

In an effort speculated to implore the media to view the 
campaign more seriously,' 52 ' Trump rolled out a tax pro- 
posal that became the subject of attention. In a series of 
telephone interviews in early November,' 52 ' Trump pro- 
posed a one-time 14.25 percent “net worth tax” that would 
apply to individuals and trusts with assets greater than $10 
million. The plan was meant to raise $5.7 trillion in rev- 
enue to wipe out the national debt, estimated at the time 
to be $5.66 trillion. The plan exempted one’s homestead 
from the calculation. Trump estimated that the tax would 
only apply to one percent of the population and that the re- 
maining 99 percent would receive a federal income tax cut 
as well as an elimination of the estate tax. He projected 
a 35 to 40 percent increase in economic activity as a result 
and eliminate $200 billion in federal interest payments, half 
of which would be used to fund middle class tax cuts and 
the rest to allocate for Social Security.' 53 ' The original plan 
provided only one year for taxpayers to pay the new tax, but 
that was later increased to 10 years. Economists predicted 
that enactment of the plan would “risk capital flight”' 54 ' and 
“prick” the stock market bubble.' 52 " 53 ' Bruce Bartlett of the 
National Center for Policy Analysis wrote in the Wall Street

Journal that the proposed rate would fall short of its goal and 
that at any rate, would introduce “devastating” disruption to 
the economic system. 1361 Tax attorney Robert L. Sommers, 
writing in the San Francisco Chronicle argued that many 
wealthy people lacked sufficient cash on hand to pay the tax 
and that doing so would lead to the mass liquidation of as- 
sets, “roil[ing] the stock and real estate markets.” 1571 Trump 
defended his plan, rejecting the speculation that it would be 
“a shock to the system.” 152 ' Roger Stone noted that Trump 
had been thinking about the plan for a while and that he felt 
so strong about it that he was willing to pay $725 million 
of his own money in taxes under it. 1571 CBS News spec- 
ulated that the plan meant to appeal to middle and lower 
class Americans. 152 ' Trump’s tax plan differed significantly 
from the plan put forward by Reform Party rival Buchanan, 
who had called for a 16 percent flat tax on earnings over 
$35,000.' 1521 

I think the only difference between me and the other can- 
didates is that I'm more honest and my women are more 
beautiful. 


Donald Trump' 581 

Despite the discussion of substantive issues, the campaign’s 
seriousness continued to come under attack. Ed Koch el- 
evated his criticisms of the campaign, calling it “fraud- 
ulent” and arguing that Trump is the “greatest con artist 
in the world when it comes to trumpeting his own name 
.... [M]y gut tells me that he knows nothing [about 
policy].” 159 ' Former White House adviser Dick Morris said 
“I think he’s mainly selling books.” Republican strategist 
Ed Rollins questioned whether Trump could “say the right 
things” or “be willing to let somebody put an organization 
together.” A New York Daily Ne vv.v/ W N B C -IV poll showed 
that 74% of New Yorkers believed the campaign was being 
used only for Trump “to promote himself.” Roger Stone 
commented that the perception problem would “solve it- 
self” once the campaign would reveal the number of pe- 
tition signatures it collected.' 60 ' By mid-November, the 
campaign started receiving advice from political consultant 
Douglas Friedline, who ran Ventura’s successful 1998 gu- 
bernatorial campaign. Upon Friedline’s advice. Trump as- 
sembled communications and campaign staff, and began 
planning events in strategic states.' 611 As an further step 
in organization. Trump set up a campaign website at the 
domain www.donaldjtrump2000.com and used Ventura’s 
webmaster Phil Madsen to create an online community of 
supporters. 1621 

On his first campaign stop. Trump traveled to Miami, 
Florida and spoke before the Cuban American National 


Foundation.' 62 ' The foundation invited Trump after he 
wrote a Miami Herald article denouncing Cuban President 
Fidel Castro and favoring the U.S. embargo against Cuba 
several months earlier.' 61 ' During the visit. Trump was met 
with supporters touting “Trump 2000” posters and shout- 
ing “Viva Donald Trump!" There, he delivered his first for- 
eign policy speech, capped with the line, “I'd have, person- 
ally, two words for [Castro]: 'Adios, amigo!'" Covering the 
event, columnist Maureen Dowd wrote that the fascination 
with Trump was the “apotheosis of our Gilded Age,” where 
“money, celebrity, polling, and crass behavior” warp poli- 
tics and the television show Who Wants to Be a Millionaire 
dominates the culture.' 58 ' Following this theme, Saturday 
Night Live performed a sketch in which Darrell Hammond 
reprised his role as Trump, holding a press conference an- 
nouncing Millionaire winner John Carpenter as his running 
mate.' 64 ' Soon thereafter, the actual Trump floated possi- 
ble running mates and members of his presidential cabinet 
during a November 28 episode of Late Edition with Wolf 
Blitzer. He identified Senator John McCain, a Republican 
presidential candidate, as a possible Secretary of Defense. 
Trump said he would consider Democratic Congressman 
Charles Rangel for Secretary of Housing and Urban Devel- 
opment and mentioned retired General Colin Powell as a 
possible Secretary of State. He praised General Electric 
CEO Jack Welch, and discussed him as either Secretary 
of Treasury or running mate. He again mentioned Oprah 
Winfrey as a possible running mate. During the inter- 
view, Trump expressed his willingness to spend $100 mil- 
lion to self-finance a full-scale campaign.' 65 ' The Reform 
Party scheduled a debate of the candidates seeking the pres- 
idential nomination on December 3 in Portland, Oregon. 
When a reporter asked a Trump aide whether Trump would 
appear, the aide was unaware of the debate. Ultimately, 
Buchanan attended but Trump did not.' 66 '

Secretary of HUD 

December 1999 



Top adviser Roger Stone was part of Trump 's campaign entourage. 

As the World Trade Organization (WTO) negotiations col- 
lapsed amid protests at a summit in Seattle, Trump ap- 
peared on the December 5 airing of ABC's This Week. He 
said that the WTO was not “necessarily fair” to the United 
States, and argued that “our best, and our smartest, and our 
brightest” were not being used to negotiate the deal. He 
renewed his attack on the negotiation skills of Barshefsky, 
saying that both she and Secretary of Commerce William 
M. Daley did not know how to negotiate. 1671 Next, Trump 
embarked on a two-day campaign stop in California, which 
the media covered extensively. During the stop. Trump held 
a press conference, appearing with his campaign entourage 
that included his girlfriend Melania, Roger Stone, and body- 
guard Matt Calamari. Aides made hand sanitizer readily 
available for reporters, presumably due to Trump’s alleged 
germaphobia. 1661 The Associated Press (AP) noted that 
Trump “made little attempt to appear statesman-like” at the 


press conference with responses that seemed “tailored more 
to entertain his listeners than establish his credibility.” 1681 
In Burbank, Trump appeared on The Tonight Show with 
Jay Leno where he attacked Buchanan as “having a love af- 
fair with Adolf Hitler” and discussed his upcoming book. 
The America We Deserve. The Weekly Standard reported 
that though the release date was only a month away, the 
book had yet to be written. 1661 After the Tonight Show ap- 
pearance, Trump attended a meeting of 100 Southern Cal- 
ifornia Reform Party members, to whom he delivered a 
speech and answered questions. Crowds cheered Trump 
when he discussed his opposition to NAFTA, but some 
were offended 1681 when he questioned the existence of a Re- 
form Party platform and, after receiving a copy, left it on the 
podium when he exited. On the final day. Trump visited 
the Simon Wiesenthal Center's Museum of Tolerance and 
walked through an exhibit of The Holocaust. He delivered 
a speech and held another press conference at the museum 
atrium, where he denounced Buchanan’s views on Nazis. 
Afterwards, Trump boarded his jet for Long Beach. 1661 
During an on-jet interview. Trump placed his odds of wag- 
ing a full-scale campaign at “50/50,” but “edging closer,” 
believing there to be a “fervor” among the public about his 
campaign. The AP evaluated the California response as 
more “warm” than fervent, but described Trump’s treatment 
as that of a “high profile dignitary.” At Trump’s final event, 
he spoke at a Tony Robbins motivational conference. 1681 
Robbins and Trump had made an agreement that would pay 
Trump $1 million for showing up at ten of Robbins’ events. 
Trump planned to make campaign stops to coincide with 
Robbins’ shows, speculating that he “could be the first pres- 
idential candidate to run and make money on it.” 1691 At the 
event. Trump received what the AP called a “moderately 
enthusiastic applause” 1681 after asking the 21,000 people in 
attendance 1661 whether he should run for president. 1681 He 
received a large ovation when he proclaimed, “people want 
to hear straight talk. We're tired of being bullied by these 
moron politicians.” Overall, The Weekly Standard praised 
Trump for his candor on the campaign trail. 1661 

In discussing his campaign strategy with The Los Angeles 
Times, Trump proclaimed, “the only strategy is, I'll be on 
television a lot.” Responding to a poll of probable Reform 
Party voters that showed him with only 14% support, fourth 
place behind Ventura (20%), Perot (25%), and Buchanan 
(30%), Trump pointed to the spike in ratings each televi- 
sion network received whenever he appeared on air. He ad- 
mitted, “whether or not TV ratings can transfer into votes is 
an interesting question.” The Times characterized Trump’s 
campaign as “Political Science 101 on how far politics is de- 
volving into pure entertainment.” 1701 Nevertheless, Trump 
contemporaneously delved into the politics of third party 
campaigns when he wrote a letter to Commission on Pres- 
idential Debates asking the body to review its standard for 


7.1. DONALD TRUMP PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN, 2000 


91 


third party candidate inclusion in the general election de- 
bates. His letter included a veiled threat of litigation if the 
body enacted a standard preventing his participation. At 
this time. Trump announced that he would make his de- 
cision on whether to wage a full-scale campaign by early 
February. 1701 In addition, he retained two signature collec- 
tion agencies in order to secure ballot access. 1711 

As 1999 drew to a close, the conflict within the Re- 
form Party escalated. To the chagrin of the Perot fac- 
tion, chairman-elect Jack Gargan pushed through a mo- 
tion to move headquarters from Perot’s home in Dallas to 
Florida. 1721 Shortly thereafter, the Perot faction incorpo- 
rated the Reform Leadership Council as an entity separate 
from the main party to preserve the vision of Perot. They 
also moved the National Convention from Ventura’s home 
in Minneapolis to Long Beach. 17 ’ 1 The Ventura faction filed 
an unsuccessful lawsuit against the Perot faction and threat- 
ened to bolt the party, prompting chairman Verney to in- 
struct, “don't let the door hit them when they leave.” 1741 As 
the conflict unfolded, Ventura publicly expressed that he 
could never support Buchanan as the party’s nominee, de- 
scribing him as “very shallow.” Ventura said that in a head- 
to-head against Buchanan, he favored Trump. Ventura and 
Trump planned a campaign event together in Minnesota to 
begin the new year. 1751 

January 2000 

Trump officially released his book The America We Deserve 
on January 1. Dave Shiflett received credit as co-writer. 7 ' 1 
To promote the book. Trump held a January 5 press confer- 
ence at Trump Tower, which aired on C-SPAN. He signed 
books and answered questions from reporters, once assert- 
ing, “I may be too honest to be a politician.” 1771 Trump’s 
book, consisting of 286 pages, 1761 covers Trump’s political 
positions and policy proposals including strict anti-crime 
measures, increased pressure on China, fair trade, border 
control, increased military spending, support for public cap- 
ital punishment, and the implementation of single-payer 
health care. 1781 It advocates eliminating soft money contri- 
butions to political parties and full disclosure of campaign 
donations to political candidates, but calls for the removal 
of limits on the amount of donations, arguing, "[i]f you want 
to give your life savings to A1 Gore, that should be between 
you, A1 Gore and your psychiatrist.” In addition, it raises 
concerns about terrorism, proposing the creation of a na- 
tional lottery to raise funds for anti-terrorism programs, 1791 
and offers a choice to North Korea to disarm or face mil- 
itary strikes. 1171 The America We Deserve also includes 
praise for former boxer Muhammad Ali, Teamsters leader 
James P. Hoffa, as well as Trump’s future political oppo- 
nents Florida governor Jeb Bush and New York governor 
George Pataki, among others. 1801 It cites friendships with

baseball player Sammy Sosa and entertainer Sean Combs 
as making Trump more understanding of racial diversity. 
Trump later backpedaled his book’s praise of Combs af- 
ter Combs was charged with violating gun laws following a 
shooting at a New York nightclub. Trump said he did not 
“know [Combs] really well.” [811 The book condemns Con- 
gressman Jerrold Nadler as a “hack” for opposing Trump’s 
development of waterfront real estate in Manhattan, and de- 
scribes Senator Bob Smith as “the dumbest guy in the U.S. 
Senate” after he grilled Trump’s sister Maryanne Trump 
Barry on abortion when she testified before the Senate Judi- 
ciary Committee in 1999 upon her nomination to the Third 
Circuit Court of Appeals. It criticizes Democratic presiden- 
tial candidate Bill Bradley as a “phony” for his Senate spon- 
sorship of the Tax Reform Act of 1986 that purportedly 
hurt Trump financially. It also notes the hypocrisy of both 
an unnamed Senator and an unnamed conservative colum- 
nist who each engaged in extramarital affairs at Trump’s 
hotels and resorts while they attacked President Clinton for 
the Lewinsky scandal. 1801 In a scathing review. New York 
Magazine described the book as inadvertently satirical. [82] 
Booklist pondered whether Trump was “the only man ever 
to run for president in order to promote a book.” 181 Dave

CHAPTER 7. POLITICAL CAREER 


Saltonstall of the New York Daily News, labeled it as auto- 
biographical and reported that it contains “enough details to 
paint a fairly comprehensive picture of what a Trump pres- 
idency might look like.” [79] 

On January 7, Trump appeared in Brooklyn Park, Min- 
nesota, where he spoke before the Chamber of Commerce, 
attended a Reform Party fundraiser, and held a joint press 
conference with Ventura. At the fundraiser. Trump iden- 
tified North Korea as the nation’s greatest foreign policy 
threat, blasted Japan for “ripping us off” for the last 25 
years, and ripped Russia as being “totally mixed up” for 
placing “people nobody ever even heard of” in charge of 
missiles. [841 At the press conference. Trump claimed he had 
yet to decide whether to run officially and so had not asked 
for Ventura’s endorsement. Ventura said that if Trump de- 
cided to run, he would give his “full consideration.” Trump 
asserted it would be “disaster for the Reform Party” if 
Pat Buchanan received the presidential nomination. 1851 De- 
scribing himself and Ventura as self-made not part of the 
“lucky sperm club,” Trump made an indirect jab at both the 
Republican frontrunner George W. Bush, the son of former 
President Bush, and Democratic frontrunner A1 Gore, son 
of the late Senator Albert Gore, Sr.. 1861 Trump and Ventura 
released a written statement opposing the Commission on 
Presidential Debates’ decision to limit debate participation 
to candidates polling above 15 percent in the general elec- 
tion and urging the Federal Election Commission to take 
action. 1871 

Trump ended his relationship with Melania Knauss in 
January 2000, removing a key figure of the campaign 
entourage. 1881 According to the New York Daily News, an 
associate of Trump said the move was meant to appease Re- 
form Party leaders. Roger Stone denied the suggestion. 1891 
In addressing the matter. Trump complimented Knauss and 
commented, “she will be missed.” 1901 Shortly thereafter, 
in an attempt to bring the two Reform Party factions to- 
gether, Trump invited party leaders to the Trump-owned 
Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida. Addressing the 
170 party members who attended the event including for- 
mer chairman Russ Verney, Trump proclaimed “I'm very 
proud to be in the party of Ross Perot and Jesse Ventura.” 
Verney appreciated the gesture and in shifting from his 
once-chilly reception to the Trump candidacy, welcoming 
him into the race. After opening the event to questions, 
one attendee asked Trump whether he would appear at the 
Florida Reform Party's state convention. Trump said he 
would consider it “very seriously.” Concerning Buchanan, 
Trump repeated he could not support Buchanan as the 
party’s nominee. 1911 Despite the retreat, the intra-party dis- 
pute over the location of the convention continued. 1921 Cit- 
ing scheduling conflicts. Trump did not attend the Florida 
Reform Party’s state convention. Reports suggested that 
Trump insiders believed Buchanan had packed the conven- 


tion with supporters and would embarrass Trump by win- 
ning all the state’s delegates. There were also growing indi- 
cations Trump was considering withdrawing from the race, 
commenting that he was “deeply concerned” about the con- 
flict within the party. 1931 In another attempt to unite the 
party’s factions. Trump wrote letters to Ventura and Perot, 
requesting the two make peace. 1941 Trump believed the in- 
stability of the party would hinder his chances of presiden- 
tial success. Stone commented that “the [Reform] party is 
melting down before our very eyes.” 192 On the final day of 
January, Trump was removed from the New York primary 
ballot after a judge determined that Trump’s supporters had 
failed to obtain the required 5,000 signatures from regis- 
tered Reform Party members. This marked a victory for 
Buchanan’s supporters, including leftist activist Fenora Fu- 
lani, who had hoped to prevent Trump from appearing on 
the ballot in his home state. 1951 


February 2000 

Despite Trump’s efforts, the conflict within the Reform 
Party escalated. A special Reform Party meeting was 
planned for Nashville at which the Perot faction was ex- 
pected to vacate the national chairmanship of Ventura ally 
Jack Gargan. 1961 Both Trump and Ventura expressed dis- 
gust with the national party. Ventura desired to disassoci- 
ate the Minnesota Reform Party from the national party. 
An unnamed official within the party told the AP that Ven- 
tura and Trump discussed a scenario where Ventura would 
run as the presidential nominee of the disaffiliated party 
with Trump as his running mate. The chairman of the Min- 
nesota Reform Party denied Ventura would be part of any 
presidential ticket. 1971 After privately notifying Trump of 
his intentions and seeking his blessing, 1981 Ventura held a 
press conference on February 12 and officially left the na- 
tional Reform Party, remaining a member of his state party, 
which he urged to disaffiliate and to return to its original 
name, the Independence Party of Minnesota. He voiced 
dissatisfaction with the presidential contest, explaining that 
Pat Buchanan was running “virtually unopposed” and re- 
ceiving support from former Ku Klux Klan leader David 
Duke; something with which Ventura could not associate. 
Ventura invited Trump to run for the presidential nomi- 
nation of the Independence Party, which Ventura believed 
could become a national entity. 1991 At the party’s next meet- 
ing, it disaffiliated. 11001 Trump considered Ventura’s invita- 
tion but had concerns, particularly the question of whether 
other state parties would affiliate with the new party. 11011 
Minnesota political scientist Steve Schier doubted the party 
could become a national entity, arguing that it was far too 
small to make an impact on the national level. [99] Ventura’s 
move came just ahead of the Nashville meeting where, with 
the rationale of failing to “faithfully perform and execute 


7.1. DONALD TRUMP PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN, 2000 


99 


the duties of his office,” Gargan was removed by a 109 to 
31 committee vote. 11021 The chaotic meeting, dominated by 
Perot-faction members, featured shoving matches and phys- 
ical squabbles as the Metropolitan Nashville Police Depart- 
ment intervened to restore order. Gargan charged that the 
meeting was illegal due to insufficient notice, though a quo- 
rum was present. 11031 

7.1.5 Withdrawal 

So the Reform Party now includes a Klansman — Mr. Duke, 
a Neo-Nazi — Mr. Buchanan, and a Communist — Ms. Fu- 
lani. 

This is not company I wish to keep. 


Donald Trump 11041 

On February 14, Trump withdrew from the race. 11051 In 
a press release, he cited infighting in the Reform Party as 
not “conducive to victory,” concluding he could not win the 
election as the party’s nominee and so, as pledged, would 
not continue his campaign. He expressed concerns about 
the direction of the party, particularly its membership, re- 
ferring to David Duke, Pat Buchanan, and Lenora Fulani as 
a Klansman, a Neo-Nazi, and a Communist, respectively. 
However, he lauded party members Russ Verney, Jack Gar- 
gan, and others as “wonderful people” he was honored to 
meet. Trump lamented the exit of Jesse Ventura from the 
party, arguing “without Jesse, the Reform Party is just an 
extremist shell and cannot be a force or even a factor in 
2000.” Trump declined to seek the nomination of Ventura’s 
new Independence Party, finding it “healthy” but too young 
to win. He expressly kept open the possibility of running 
for president in 2004. 11041 Trump publicly announced his 
withdrawal on The Today Show in an interview with Matt 
Lauer. He explained that though he still could have won the 
Reform Party nomination, he believed he would only win 
20 percent in the general election, which he did not want. 
He claimed the party was on the verge of “self-destructing” 
and referred to it as a “total mess.” 198 In response, Pat 
Choate, who became the new Reform Party chairman af- 
ter the unseating of Gargan, disputed Trump’s claim about 
the party 11061 and said Trump’s campaign was meant only 
“to smear Pat Buchanan.” 11071 He declared Trump “unwel- 
come” to seek the party’s 2004 presidential nomination. 11061 
Choate later remarked that he believed Trump’s campaign 
was a “Republican dirty trick” orchestrated by Roger Stone 
“to disgust people and drive them away from the Reform 
Party.” 11081 Stone argued that John McCain “running on 
Trump’s message” and surging in the polls signaled an end 


to the Trump campaign. 1691 

Several days after withdrawing. Trump reflected on his 
campaign in an editorial published in The New York Times 
titled “What I Saw at the Revolution.” Disputing the claim 
that he ran for the publicity. Trump countered that he felt 
the nation was ready for a non-establishment “businessman 
president” who offered “straight talk.” He cited three rea- 
sons for dropping out: (1) the criteria of the Commission 
on Presidential Debates, which would have made it “im- 
possible” for him to qualify for general election debates; 
(2) the rise of the presidential campaign of John McCain, 
whose similar message would have made a contrast difficult; 
and (3) the exit of Ventura from the Reform Party. Trump 
called his run the “greatest civics lesson that a private citi- 
zen can have,” but said it was “enormous fun” and a “great 
life experience,” though it “doesn't compare with complet- 
ing one of the great skyscrapers of Manhattan.” 11091 


7.1.6 Results 

During the campaign. Trump qualified for the Michigan and 
California Reform Party presidential primaries. Both of 
these elections were held after Trump exited the race. 11101 
On February 22, Trump won the Michigan Primary with 
2,164 votes defeating uncommitted with 948 votes. 11111 
Trump won the California primary on March 7 with 15,3 1 1 
votes (44.28%) defeating perennial candidate George D. 
Weber who received 9,390 votes (27.16%), former Di- 
rector of Advanced Space Programs Development Robert 
M. Bowman who received 4,879 (14.11%), former Con- 
gressman John B. Anderson who received 3,158 (9.13%), 
and political activist Charles E. Collins who received 1,837 
(5. 31%). 11121 Pat Buchanan was not listed on either ballot. 
A slate of Trump supporters petitioned to list Trump on the 
New York Independence Party presidential primary ballot 
but were denied on a technicality. 11131 

Pat Buchanan eventually won the Reform Party presiden- 
tial nomination at a chaotic 11141 National Convention in 
Long Beach in August 2000. 1 1 151 Buchanan had lost the sup- 
port of the Perot faction, which accused Buchanan of fraud 
and held a counter-convention, nominating Buchanan’s only 
major opponent physicist John Hagelin of the Natural Law 
Party. 1 1 161 According to Russ Verney, the Perot faction lost 
faith in Buchanan when he emphasized pro-life and anti- 
homosexual issue positions after promising to respect the 
party’s neutral stance on social issues. 11171 After the filing 
of a complaint over the party’s matching funds, the FEC 
ruled against the Perot faction and invalided the Hagelin 
selection. 11181 The decision was affirmed on appeal. On 
Election Day, Buchanan appeared on the ballot in all 50 
states and received 448,895 votes, 0.42% of the popu- 
lar vote. George W. Bush defeated A1 Gore in a close

7.1.7 Aftermath 


Trump in 2015 


After the election. Trump returned to his real estate busi- 
ness, rekindled his relationship with Melania Knauss, whom 
he married in 2005, 11221 and hosted NBC’s The Appren- 
tice and The Celebrity Apprentice for 14 seasons from 2004 
to 2015, acquiring the catchphrase, "You're fired!". 1122 
In addition, he continued an involvement in politics. He 
changed his voter registration from the New York Inde- 
pendence Party (Reform Party affiliate) to the Democratic 
Party in August 2001 121 as the Reform Party continued its 
decline. By 2004 the party had lost ballot access in all but 
seven states, which it gave to Independent presidential can- 
didate Ralph Nader. 11241 Trump was critical of the George 
W. Bush administration’s handling of the Iraq War 11251 and 
publicly endorsed Bush’s impeachment. 11261 He considered 
challenging Bush in the 2004 Republican presidential pri-

maries, but ultimately decided against it. 11271 Jesse Ven- 
tura, who choose not ran for re-election as Governor of 
Minnesota in 2002, 1 2S also considered a 2004 presidential 
run and publicly asked for and received Trump’s support at 
Wrestle Mania XX. 11291 However, Ventura did not run. 

In 2009, Trump changed his voter registration from Demo- 
crat back to Republican. 121 He seriously considered run- 
ning for president as a Republican in 2012 and led in 
an April 2011 Rasmussen Reports survey. 11301 While con- 
sidering a run. Trump emphasized China’s currency ma- 
nipulation and criticized the trade policies of the Barack 
Obama administration. 11311 Additionally, he questioned the 
legitimacy of Obama’s citizenship and birth certificate. 11321 
He decided not to run in May 2011,' 1331 but proclaimed 
“I maintain the strong conviction that if I were to run, I 
would be able to win the primary and, ultimately, the gen- 
eral election.” 11341 After reports that a group in Texas was 
attempting to create the “Make America Great Again Party” 
with the intention of running Trump as a candidate, 1135 ' 
Trump briefly considered a 2012 Independent bid and 
changed his voter registration from Republican to “I do 
not wish to enroll in a party.”' 2 " 1361 Trump said he would 
run if the Republicans selected the “wrong candidate.” 1135 ' 
Ultimately, he again decided against running. Trump re- 
registered as a Republican in 201 2' 2 ' and publicly en- 
dorsed Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney for 
president. 11 371 

After much speculation. Trump officially decided to run 
for president as a Republican in 2016 using the motto 
“Make America Great Again.” In his announcement speech 
in June 2015, Trump took a tough stance against illegal 
immigration and promised to build a wall on the U.S.- 
Mexico border if elected president.' 1381 After announcing. 
Trump became the front-runner for the nomination, tak- 
ing the lead in nearly every national poll, ahead of his ri- 
vals for the Republican nomination including Jeb Bush and 
retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson.' 139 ' Trump has styled 
himself as the candidate of anti-establishment Republicans 
and has received praise from former rival Pat Buchanan 
who compares Trump’s run to Buchanan’s 1992 and 1996 
campaigns.' 140 ' His attacks on the Republican establish- 
ment included a slight against the war hero status of John 
McCain, whom Trump complimented during his 2000 
campaign.' 141 ' Republican voters favor the purported hon- 
esty of Trump’s message and his abrasive approach,' 142 ' 
which eschews political correctness.' 143 ' Roger Stone, who 
headed Trump’s 2000 presidential committee, served as an 
adviser for the 2016 campaign until a much publicized split 
in August 20 1 5 . ' 1 44 ' The campaign has generated major 
media attention. An October 2 Rasmussen Reports poll re- 
vealed 58% of Republicans believe Trump will be the 2016 
Republican presidential nominee.' 145 '

For his 2000 presidential campaign, see Donald Trump 
presidential campaign, 2000. 

The 2016 presidential campaign of Donald John 
Trump, businessman and television personality, formally 
launched on June 16, 2015. 131 Donald Trump announced 
his candidacy for President of the United States in the 2016 
election at the Trump Tower in New York City with the slo- 
gan "Make America Great Again!" 141 His campaign man- 
ager is Corey Lewandowski. 151 

Trump’s populist and nativist politics 161171 brought him 
support among Republican working-class voters, espe- 
cially voters without college educations, 181 as well as white 
supremacists 191 and hate groups promoting racial bigotry 
such as the Ku Klux Klan and Stormfront, whose endorse- 
ments Trump has publicly declined to repudiate, |10, and 
who have attributed a notable recent surge in their popular- 
ity to Trump’s campaign, 1111 amid heavy and frequent con- 
troversies in the news media. 1121 His proposed policies and 
his statements about the state of the country have propelled 
him to be the consistent Republican front-runner in public 
opinion polls. 11311141 A number of his remarks are regarded 
as highly offensive by the public, other political candidates, 
the media, and Trump’s business partners, many of whom 
have terminated their business relationships with Trump 
over his incendiary racial remarks, as in his description of

undocumented Mexican immigrants to the United States as 
“rapists” and “drug dealers. Many political analysts suggest 
that Trump deliberately makes these inflammatory remarks 
to increase media coverage of his campaign in the absence 
of significant campaign contributions or supporting Polit- 
ical Action Committees, which Trump has criticized.. 1151 
1 1 6 1 1 1 7 ] [_[j s 0 f political correctness, habit of describing 
various ethnic and demographic groups such as Muslims, 
Mexicans, and women in perjorative, sterotypical terms, 
and his willingness to openly insult members of the media, 
fellow political candidates, and religious leaders such as the 
Pope for what he perceives to be their personal flaws, in- 
cluding their appearance, has been a staple theme of his 
campaign, and has proved to be popular among his sup- 
porters, reputedly earning him the nickname “The Glori- 
ous Leader” in some White Nationalist circles. 1 1X11 1911201 
Trump’s most polarizing and widely reported statements 
have been on issues of immigration and border security, 
with Trump proposing deportation of all illegal immigrants, 
a substantial wall on the Mexican-American border, and a 
temporary ban on alien Muslims entering the U.S., 1211 while 
speaking extensively about perceived issues pertaining to il- 
legal immigrants travelling over the Mexican border into 
the U.S. [22] 1231 [24] 

In the 2016 Iowa caucus, Trump ranked second out of all 
the Republican nominees, garnering 24% of the vote, be- 
hind Ted Cruz with 28%. 1251 1261 Trump later won the New 
Hampshire primary with slightly over 35% of the vote, 1271 
the South Carolina primary with 33%, 1281 and the Nevada 
caucus with 46%. 1291 


7.2.1 Background 

Further information: Donald Trump presidential cam- 

paign, 2000 

Since the 1988 presidential election. Trump has been con- 
sidered a potential candidate for President in nearly every 
election. 130113111321 In October 1999, Trump declared him- 
self a potential candidate for the Reform Party's presiden- 
tial nomination, 1331 but withdrew on February 14, 2000. 1341 
In 2004, Donald Trump identified as a Democrat, openly 
supported Hillary Clinton, and donated a large sum of 
money to Democratic groups. 1351 Trump rejoined the Re- 
publican Party in 2009. In early 2011, presidential spec- 
ulation reached its highest point and Trump began to take 
a lead in polls among Republican candidates in the 2012 
election. However, Trump announced in May 2011 that he 
would not be a candidate for the office. 13611371 

At the 2011 Conservative Political Action Conference 
(CPAC), Trump said he is “pro-life” and “against 
gun control”. 138113911401 He has spoken before Tea Party 


supporters. 141114211431 In December 2008, Trump emerged 
as an early supporter of the 2009 government backed res- 
cue plan for the U.S. auto industry which by 2012 gained 
the support of 56% of Americans (63% support in Michi- 
gan), according to a Pew Research Center poll. 14411451 In 
May 2015, Trump said he was opposed to granting Pres- 
ident Barack Obama fast track trade authority in a Trans- 
pacific Partnership. 1461 Instead, Trump expressed a desire 
for stronger negotiations with China on trade together with 
tariffs if necessary. 147114811491 Trump has called for a policy 
of leadership to deal with the Organization of Petroleum 
Exporting Countries (OPEC) which he has criticized for 
causing high oil prices. 15011511 

In 2011, polls had Trump among the leading candidates. 
A Wall Street Journal I NBC News poll from March 2011 
showed Trump in the lead for the Republican nomination 
for president of the United States. 1521 A February 2011 
Newsweek poll placed Trump within a few points of Pres- 
ident Obama in a potential 2012 presidential contest, with 
many voters undecided. 1531 A poll released in April 2011 
by Public Policy Polling showed Trump having a nine-point 
lead in a potential contest for the Republican nomination 
for President of the United States while he was still actively 
considering a run. 15411551 In December 2011, Trump placed 
sixth in the “ten most admired men and women living of 
201 1” USA Today/Gallup telephone survey. 1561 Trump has 
been a featured speaker at the Conservative Political Ac- 
tion Conference (CPAC). 1571 In 2013, Trump researched a 
possible run for President of the United States in 20 1 6. 1581 
In October 2013, New York Republicans suggested Trump 
should run for governor of the state in 2014. 1591 In February 
2015, Trump did not renew his television contract for The 
Apprentice, which raised speculation of his candidacy for 
president of the United States in 20 16. 1601

7.2. DONALD TRUMP PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN, 2016 


107 


Trump formally announced his candidacy for the presi- 
dency in the 2016 election on June 16, 20 15. 131 1611 1621 His 
announcement came at a campaign rally at Trump Tower 
in New York City. 16 11 1621 1631 Trump said, “We are go- 
ing to make our country great again” and also announced 
that he would be the “greatest jobs president that God 
ever created.” 1621 His 45-minute presidential campaign an- 
nouncement speech, the longest of the major party can- 
didates to date, included a pledge to restore the “Amer- 
ican dream ... bigger and better and stronger than ever 
before.” 1631164 Trump said he would keep Iran from ac- 
quiring nuclear weapons, and criticized John Kerry's Ira- 
nian negotiations. He also criticized Kerry’s overall judg- 
ment, in breaking 1651 his leg (at age 71) riding his bicycle; 
Trump made a campaign promise “never [to] be in a bicycle 
race.” 166 In the speech. Trump also pledged he would fund 
Social Security, renegotiate U.S. trade agreements, oppose 
federal Common Core education standards, and complete 
the United States-Mexico border fence and make Mexico 
pay for it. 13116611671 Trump said he would self fund his pres- 
idential campaign, and would not need to use money from 
donors and lobbyists. 1661 

Most attention focused on Trump’s comment on illegal im- 
migration where he stated in part “When Mexico sends its 
people, they're not sending their best... They're sending 
people that have lots of problems, and they're bringing those 
problems with [them]. They're bringing drugs. They're 
bringing crime. They're rapists. And some, I assume, are 
good people.’’ 16811691 

The comment on illegal immigrants entering the 
United States through Mexico led several businesses 
and organizations — including NBC, Macy’s, Univision, and 
NASCAR (along with sponsor Camping World) — to cut 
ties with Trump in the following days. 1701 1711 1721 1731 1741 1751 1761 
Reactions from other presidential candidates were mixed, 
with some Republican candidates disagreeing with the 
tone of Trump’s remarks yet supporting the core idea 
that illegal immigration is an important campaign issue, 
other Republican candidates preferring to avoid intra-party 
feuds with other Republican candidates and concentrate 
on putting forth their own positions, and several Re- 
publican candidates criticizing both Trump’s remarks 
and his policy-stances (as did leading Democratic party 

Candidates) ^ ower_a ^P^ a 1 ] [lower-alpha 2] [lower-alpha 3] [lower-alpha 4] 

Beyond the candidates, journalistic response to Trump’s 
statement ranged from negative 186118911901191119211931 to neu- 
tral or positive. 1931194119511961 Fact-checking the comment, 
Washington Post wrote that the allegation of a correlation 
between illegal immigration and crime was false and gave 
the statement four pinocchios. 197 Republican politician 
Steve King said he admired Trump’s response to the 
backlash, saying that Trump “delivers more facts to 
support [his] statement” and that on the subject of illegal 


immigration Trump is more accurate than not. 1981 Rudy 
Giuliani, who ran in 2008, said Trump’s statement could 
have been better stated, and that most illegal immigrants 
are good people who come to the country to work, but that 
an insecure border does also let in “terrorists, drug dealers, 
rapists, murderers, all of whom I've prosecuted.” 1 " 1 Vari- 
ous families of the victims of crimes committed by illegal 
immigrants have come forth in support of Trump. 11001 For 
his part. Trump has defended his comments, 11011 claimed 
that “Democrats and [my] enemies” 1861 picked a relatively 
small portion of his announcement speech to criticize, cited 
news articles to back up his claims 11021 and made illegal 
immigration a major issue in his campaign. 11031 Trump 
later said that he intended his comments to be aimed solely 
at the government of Mexico, specifically for using the 
insecure border as a means of transferring criminals out of 
their own country, and says he did not intend his comments 
to refer to immigrants themselves in general. 1881 

Trump’s announcement generated the highest Google 
search volume of any of the presidential candidates to 
date. 11041 According to Politico, the speech was “discursive, 
pugnacious... bizarre... most entertaining.” 1661 Trump’s an- 
nouncement speech included the song "Rockin' in the Free 
World", causing Neil Young, the author of this song, to 
distance himself from Trump; Young supports Democratic 
candidate Bernie Sanders. 11051 Despite a casting company 
having sent emails (some of which have leaked) to back- 
ground actors explicitly asking them to cheer Trump for 
money, Trump’s campaign manager denied that Trump paid 
any actors to cheer him at the event. 1106111071110811109111101 
An early supporter of Ronald Reagan for president. Trump 
trademarked the campaign slogan from the 1980 election,

Immediately after his announcement in New York, Trump 
traveled to Iowa to campaign in the state ahead of the first- 
in-the-nation Iowa caucus. 11 1 1 1 Trump has also campaigned 
extensively in New Hampshire, site of the first Republi- 
can primary. 1 1 12111131 Trump’s campaign cancelled events in 
Charleston, South Carolina, in light of the June 17 mass 
shooting. 11141 Trump kicked off a western swing in early 
July 2015, giving rallies and speeches in Las Vegas 11151 and 
Los Angeles. 11161 

In June, Trump said that he would like to have Oprah Win- 
frey as his running mate. 1 1 171 

On July 22, the Federal election regulators released new de- 
tails of Trump’s wealth and financial holdings that he sub-

mitted when he became a Republican presidential candi- 
date. Trump’s campaign released a statement claiming his 
net worth to be over US$10 billion, but Forbes estimates 
that it is US$4 billion. 1 1 18 On July 23, he visited the Mexi- 
can border to highlight his stance with regards to opposition 
towards illegal immigration. The border patrol union pulled 
out of the planned event. 11191 

Michael Cohen, Trump’s senior counsel, was criticized for 
claiming that “you cannot rape your spouse” in response to 
a Daily Beast article about Trump’s divorce proceedings. 
The article related how Ivana Trump had accused her ex- 
husband of raping her, a claim she has since retracted. Co- 
hen subsequently apologized for his comments.' 120 ' 

In response to a question asking candidates during the first 
primary debate, the main Fox News debate held on Au- 
gust 6, 2015, whether they would pledge to support the Re- 
publican party in the general election. Trump refused to 
rule out a third-party candidacy. When pressed, he also 
refused to say he would endorse the eventual Republican 
nominee . ' 1 2 1 ' After meeting with Reince Priebus ( chairman 
of the Republican National Committee) in New York, dur- 
ing a news conference at Trump Tower on September 3, 
Trump announced he had signed the loyalty pledge. 1122 ' 

On August 21, 2015, the Federal Election Commission re- 
leased the list of filings from Super PAC's backing can- 
didates in the 2016 presidential race, which revealed that 
Trump is the only major presidential candidate among the 
GOP candidates who does not have a Super PAC support- 
ing his candidacy. 1 1221 

On December 21, 2015, Trump attacked Hillary Clinton 
saying that her bathroom break during the last Democratic 
debate was just too “disgusting” to talk about and then stat- 
ing she “got schlonged” by Barack Obama in the 2008 pres- 
idential race. 11241 Trump responded to critical coverage of 
these statements by saying the mainstream media is “dis- 
honest”, that the term “schlonged” was not vulgar, and cit- 


ing a 1984 NPR report in which the term was used to mean 
“beaten badly”.! 125 " 126 " 127 ' 



Trump and supporters attend a rally in Muscatine, Iowa in January 
2016. Multiple supporters hold up signs, which read ‘The silent 
majority stands with Trump”. 


Rallies and crowds 

Trump regularly holds crowds with more people in atten- 
dance than any other 2016 presidential candidate. 1 1281 More 
than 9,000 people registered to attend Trump’s rally on July 
11, 2015 at the Phoenix Convention Center.' 129 " 130 ' Trump 
was introduced by Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio. 
During his speech. Trump invoked Richard Nixon's "silent 
majority" speech, saying “The silent majority is back.” 1131 ' 

On July 24, the Des Moines Register announced that it had 
been denied press credentials to cover a Trump campaign 
family picnic in Oskaloosa, Iowa, due to an editorial the 
previous week which called on Trump to drop out of the 
race. 1132 ' 1133 ' 

On August 21, Trump held a campaign rally at the Ladd- 
Peebles Stadium in Mobile, Alabama, with approximately 
30,000 people in attendance.' 134 ' 

During an August 25 press conference, Trump’s chief of 
security Keith Schiller forcibly ejected Univision anchor 
Jorge Ramos.' 135 " 136 ' On September 3, Schiller was filmed 
punching a protester.' 137 ' 

On January 2, 2016, Trump’s campaign rally in Biloxi, 
Mississippi, set a record for most people ever attending 
a political function in the history of the state.' 1 ’ 8 ' At the 
Biloxi rally, the YouTuber duo Diamond and Silk riled up 
the crowd, urging Democrats and independents in the au- 
dience to “ditch and switch”, i.e. to register as Republi- 
cans and vote for Trump if they really wanted to show their 
support.' 139 ' It is believed that this could be an important 
strategy for the Trump campaign as it might be relying on 
people who do not tend to vote and trying to persuade some

Democrats and independents to change parties so that they 
can vote in states that allow only registered Republicans to 
participate. 1 1,91 

Trump’s campaign, scheduled for a January 7, 2016, ap- 
pearance in the traditionally liberal city of Burlington, Ver- 
mont, came under scrutiny for releasing approximately 
20,000 tickets for a 1,400-person venue. The Burlington 
mayor and police chief both expressed concern for a public- 
safety risk from crowds of people, likely including many 
protesters, to be turned away from entry. 11401 


Media coverage 

Trump is “by far the most newsworthy storyline of Cam- 
paign 2016, accounting alone for more than a quarter of 
all coverage” on NBC, CBS and ABC’s evening news- 
casts, Andrew Tyndall said. 1 141] [142] [143] [144] j n res p 0nse _ a 
petition to “Stop promoting Donald Trump” accused the 
media of “relentlessly chasing ratings and devoting mas- 
sive airtime to Donald Trump interviews and live cover- 
age of his speeches” and quickly amassed over 200,000 
signatures. 1145111461 The media’s coverage of Trump has 
generated some disagreement as to its affect on his 
campaign. 1147 ' John Sides of The Washington Post said, 
“Trump is surging in the polls because the news media 
has consistently focused on him.”' 148 ' In a later analysis. 
The Washington Post said, “support for Trump appears 
to increase in spite of media coverage declining.”' 149 ' A 
Rasmussen Reports survey showed that 47% of likely vot- 
ers think most reporters are biased against Trump, 31% 
disagree, but 22% are not sure.' 150 ' Politico said, “blam- 
ing the press for the Trump surge neglects the salient fact 
that so much of the coverage of him has been darkly 
negative.”' 151 " 152 " 153 ' 

TV appearances and coverage of his tweets, rallies and con- 
troversial statements allowed Trump to dominate the me- 
dia landscape on the cheap.' 154 ' In an interview with CBS, 
Trump said of his campaign’s plans to purchase advertis- 
ing, “I think I’m probably wasting the money. But I'm $35 
million under budget. Look, I was going to have 35 or 40 
million spent by now. I haven't spent anything. I almost feel 
guilty ... I'm leading by, as you all say, a lot. You can take 
the CBS poll. You can take any poll and I'm winning by 
a lot. I don't think I need the ads. But I'm doing them. I 
almost feel guilty.” [I551[156][I57 ' 

Some conservative leaning media sources have covered 
Trump negatively. In January 2016, National Review re- 
leased a special issue “Against Trump” in opposition to 
Trump’s bid for the presidency.' 158 " 159 " 160 ' A statement is- 
sued by Fox News days before the GOP Debate preceding 
the Iowa Caucus said, “We learned from a secret back chan- 
nel that the Ayatollah and Putin both intend to treat Donald 


Trump unfairly when they meet with him if he becomes 
president — a nefarious source tells us that Trump has his 
own secret plan to replace the Cabinet with his Twitter fol- 
lowers to see if he should even go to those meetings.”' 161 ' 
Trump responded by criticizing the “wise-guy press re- 
lease” and said he would instead host a competing event 
in the state designed to raise money for wounded veterans, 
which he held the day of the debate.' 162 " 163 ' 

Trump has frequently criticized the media, saying “the me- 
dia is among the worst people I've ever met, I mean a pretty 
good percentage is really a terrible group of people. They 
write lies, they write false stories. They know they're false. 
It makes no difference. And frankly I don't call it thin- 
skinned, I'm angry.”' 164 " 165 " 166 ' He has constantly called 
upon his supporters to be “the silent majority”, apparently 
referencing the media.' 131 ' At a rally in Fort Worth, Texas 
in February 2016, Trump stated that if elected he would 
“open up our libel laws so when they write purposely neg- 
ative and horrible and false articles, we can sue them and 
win lots of money”, specifically referencing the New York 
Times and the Washington Post.' 167 " 168 ' 

Border wall and illegal immigration 

See also: Political positions of Donald Trump § Border 
wall between U.S. and Mexico 

In his announcement speech. Trump promised that he 
would build “a great, great wall” on the United States- 
Mexico border, and has continued to lay emphasis on 
this proposal throughout his campaign, further stating 
that the construction of the wall would be paid for by 
Mexico.' 68 " 169 ' He proposed a broader crack-down on il- 
legal immigration, and in a statement of July 6 claimed that 
the Mexican government is “forcing their most unwanted 
people into the United States” — "in many cases, criminals, 
drug dealers, rapists, etc.”' 170 ' In his first town hall meet- 
ing in Derry, New Hampshire on August 19, 2015, Trump 
stated: “Day 1 of my presidency, they're getting out and 
getting out fast.”' 171 ' These statements elicited considerable 
controversy.' 170 ' 

Jose Antonio Meade Kuribrena, Mexican Secretary of 
Foreign Affairs, said that Trump “is a politician who ig- 
nores the context in which it is participating”, with re- 
gard to U.S. international economic relations and Trump’s 
comments.' 172 ' Trump’s Republican rival Jeb Bush stated 
that “Trump is wrong on this” and “to make these extraor- 
dinarily kind of ugly comments is not reflective of the Re- 
publican Party.”' 173 ' Trump acknowledged that Republican 
National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus asked him 
to tone down his rhetoric on immigration reform and stated 
that his conversations with the RNC were “congratulatory”

was murdered by an illegal immigrant in 2008, came for- 
ward to defend Trump, with Anita Shaw stating on July 7, 
2015, that, “it’s time people listened to Trump” and “this 
guy who is running for President, Donald Trump, he’s trying 
to do something and they're trying to shut him down.” 11751 
Jamiel Shaw spoke at the podium for Trump’s July 1 1 rally 
at the Phoenix convention center, in part declaring, “I Trust 
Donald Trump.” 14761 Two days later, escaped high-profile 
druglord Joaquin Guzman was alleged to have issued threats 
through a Twitter account against Trump. 11771 The brother 
of Kate Steinle who was shot in San Francisco criticized 
Trump for politicizing his sisters death, telling Anderson 
Cooper Trump’s platform “isn't exactly what our family be- 
lieves in.” [178 J 

U.S. Senator Ted Cruz saluted Trump for giving atten- 
tion to illegal immigration, while Congressman Steve King 
also defended Trump’s remarks about illegal immigration 
and crime. 1791198111791 Conservative radio host Rush Lim- 
baugh has repeatedly praised Trump’s comments and his 
continued response to the backlash, saying that Trump has 
successfully changed the debate and brought the issue of 
immigration reform back to the foreground, while also not 
backing down against media scrutiny and businesses sever- 
ing ties with him. 1 1 s<) 1 1 1 s 1 1 1 1 82 1 Former Arizona governor Jan 
Brewer said, “I believe that Mr. Trump is kind of telling it 
like it really, truly is.”*- 179 -' 1 183 1 1 184 1 Over 36,000 criminally 
convicted illegal immigrants were released by U.S. Immi- 
gration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in 2013. [1851[1861 
On July 10, 2015, Limbaugh cited a report which he 
claimed supports Trump’s remarks about illegal immigra- 
tion and crime. 11871 

Univision announced it would no longer carry broadcasts of 
the Miss USA Pageant. 11881 In response. Trump indicated 
the matter would be handled by legal action, and followed 
through by filing a US$500 million lawsuit against Univi- 
sion. The complaint asserts that Univision is attempting to 
suppress Trump’s First Amendment rights by putting pres- 
sure on his business ventures. 11891 NBC announced it would 
not air the Miss Universe or Miss USA pageant. [19 ° 1[1911 Af- 
terwards, the multinational media company Grupo Televisa 
severed ties with Trump, 1 1921 as did Ora TV, [I93] a televi- 
sion network partly owned by Mexican billionaire Carlos 
Slim. 11941 Trump gave the rights to broadcast the Miss Uni- 
verse and Miss USA Pageants to the Reelz Channel. [195] 

Paulina Vega, the current Miss Universe and former Miss 
Colombia, said that, although she repudiates the immi- 
gration remarks of Trump, 11961 who in turn called her a

Temporary Muslim ban proposal 

See also: Political positions of Donald Trump § Muslims 

In remarks made following the November 2015 Paris at- 
tacks, Trump stated that he would support a database track- 
ing Muslims in the United States and expanded surveil- 
lance of mosques. 12081 12091 Trump justified his views by stat- 
ing that he recalled “thousands and thousands of people 
... cheering” when the World Trade Center towers fell on 
September 11, 2001. [208] On December 7, 2015, Trump 
further called for a “total and complete shutdown on Mus- 
lims entering the United States until our country’s represen- 
tatives can figure out what the hell is going on.” |2l,)| 

Following these remarks, on December 8, 2015, the 
Pentagon issued a rare statement of concern, stating “any- 
thing that bolsters ISIL’s narrative and pits the United States 
against the Muslim faith is certainly not only contrary to 
our values but contrary to our national security.” 12111 The 
Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, David Cameron, 
and the Prime Minister of France, Manuel Vails, both is- 
sued statements in response to Trump’s press release con- 
demning him. 1212112131 However, Geert Wilders, leader of 
the right-wing Party for Freedom in the Netherlands ap- 
plauded his remarks calling them “brave” and “good for 
Europe”. [2141 Among the European right wing, Nigel Farage 
of the UK Independence Party called it “perhaps a political 
mistake too far”, 1215 and Marine Le Pen of the conservative 
French National Front separated herself from the idea. 12161 
Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli Prime Minister, rejected 
Trump’s proposal. 12171 

Trump was widely criticized by leading GOP figures, 
including Reince Priebus |2l8||2|y and Republican lead- 
ers in South Carolina and Iowa. 12201 A number of com- 
mentators and news outlets subsequently likened Trump 

to a fascist [221][222] [ 223][224 ] or Adolf Hitler. I 225 ™ 227 ! 


7.2. DONALD TRUMP PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN, 2016

Other commentators and news outlets refuted the labels as 
obscene, 12281 with Gianni Riotta, saying, “I am dead sure: 
Trump is not a fascist. Using the label not only belittles 
past tragedies and obscures future dangers, but also indicts 
his supporters, who have real grievances that mainstream 
politicians ignore at their peril.” 122911230112311 

During the controversy regarding his comments. Trump al- 
leged that “We have places in London and other places that 
are so radicalized that the police are afraid for their own 
lives.” The Metropolitan Police, responsible for policing 
in London, responded by stating “we think it’s important 
to state to Londoners that Mr Trump could not be more 
wrong.” Conservative Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, 
demanded an apology and described Trump’s comments 
as “ill-informed” and “complete and utter nonsense.” 12321 
Several Metropolitan police officers backed Trump’s claim; 
“Trump’s not wrong; we can't wear uniform in our own 
cars.” 12331 

Following Trump’s controversial comments on Muslim im- 
migration, a petition with the title “Block Donald J Trump 
from UK entry” 12341 was opened in the UK, on the Parlia- 
ment’s e-petition website, calling on the UK government’s 
Home Office to ban him from entering the country. By 
5:00 am on December 11, the total number of signatures 
exceeded 500, 000, 12351 far above the threshold of 100,000 
required for a Parliamentary debate. 12361 On January 18, 
the UK’s House of Commons debated whether to ban 
Trump, 12371 but ended without a vote, as UK members of 
parliament did not have the power to enact such a ban. 12381 
The three-hour long debate saw members on all sides of 
parliament describe Trump as “a buffoon”, “crazy”, “of- 
fensive”, and “a wazzock”. 12391 

Trump caused further outrage when he recounted a story 
about how U.S. general John J. Pershing shot Muslim ter- 
rorists with pig’s blood-dipped bullets in order to deter 
them during the Moro Rebellion. His comments were 
strongly denounced by the Council on American-Islamic 
Relations. 12401124111242112431 

John McCain 

Arizona Senator John McCain was not supportive of 
Trump’s position on illegal immigration, and in an inter- 
view with The New Yorker said, “what he did was he fired 
up the crazies.” 1244112451 Trump later asked McCain for an 
apology. 12461 McCain did not apologize, saying “crazies” 
was “a term of endearment”, and “a term of affection”. 12471 

Trump received criticism for saying of McCain: “He’s not 
a war hero” and “He was a war hero because he was cap- 
tured. I like people who weren’t captured.” 1248112491 Trump 
acknowledged, “If somebody’s a prisoner, I consider them 
a war hero"; however, he criticized “politicians like John 


McCain” for having “totally failed” on veterans issues and 
on securing the border. 12- ’ 01 Trump declared his support for 
veterans and pledged to “build the finest and most modern 
veterans hospitals in the world.” 1250112511 

Asked whether Trump should apologize to him for the 
remarks, McCain said on MSNBC: “I don’t think so. I 
think he may owe an apology to the families of those who 
have sacrificed in conflict and those who have undergone 
the prison experience in serving their country.” 1232112531 
Trump later stated that he did not owe the Senator 
an apology. 125411255112561 Investigative journalist Sharyl At- 
tkisson detailed how the Washington Post had taken 
Trump’s remarks on McCain out of context; she stated in 
part, “In fact, Trump’s actual quote is the opposite of what 
is presented in the Post’s first sentence.” 12571 Politifact rated 
Trump’s claim that the quote was taken out of context as 
“mostly false”. 12581 Trump’s comments generated disagree- 
ment among the other Republican presidential candidates, 
including Jeb Bush, Scott Walker, Rick Santorum, Rand 
Paul, Bobby Jindal, Mike Huckabee, and Chris Christie. 
Two candidates, George Pataki and Rick Perry, openly 
called on Trump to withdraw from the race over his com- 
ments. Conversely, two other candidates came to Trump’s 
defense: Ben Carson and Ted Cruz, with Carson comment- 
ing that all differing opinions should be heard, and with 
Cruz opining that the party should stop its infighting alto- 
gether in order to unite. 1259112601 Before the first voting in 
Iowa, all the candidates who criticized Trump had either 
withdrawn or were in single-digit popularity polling. 12611 

Lindsey Graham 

On July 21, Trump publicly gave out Senator Lindsey Gra- 
ham's phone number during a speech in South Carolina as 
a response to Graham calling him a “jackass”. 1262112631 Gra- 
ham released a statement on Twitter that he would “prob- 
ably [be] getting a new phone” 12621 and later released a 
video in which he destroyed his phone. 12641 Gawker subse- 
quently released a phone number belonging to Trump, 12651 
and he responded by setting the phone number to play a 
campaign message. Trump’s response was described as 
“brilliant” and Time Magazine said, “You can't out-troll the 
Donald.” 1266112671 


Jeb Bush 

The Jeb Bush-Trump dynamic was one of the most fiery 
relationships among the Republican contenders. 1268112691 
Bush’s campaign spent millions of dollars on anti-Trump 
ads, 127011271112721 while in response Trump mocked 
Jeb Bush with the lasting epithet that he was “low 
energy”. 127311274112751 During an exchange with Jeb

CHAPTER 7. POLITICAL CAREER 


Bush in the ninth GOP Debate in South Carolina, 
the audience (most favoring Bush) repeatedly boo'd 
Trump/ 2761127711278112791 Trump scoffed that the au- 
dience was made up of “Jeb’s special interests and 
lobbyists"/ 27611280112811 When asked whether he remained 
in favor of impeachment for George W. Bush for starting 
the Iraq War, Trump said, “They [the George W. Bush 
administration] bed. They said there were weapons of mass 
destruction. There were none. And they knew there were 
none. There were no weapons of mass destruction.” 12821 12831 

Yet, according to the Washington Post, the most telling as- 
pect of the Bush-Trump duel may have been the fact that, 
“No candidate in the race was prepared for GOP voters’ 
opposition to immigration, with the exception of Trump,” 
and the anti -immigration sentiment that Trump tapped into 
throughout the campaign, and, tellingly, with the Act of 
Love (advertisement). 12841 


Fox News and Megyn Kelly 

Trump was one of ten candidates in the main Fox News 
debate on August 6, 2015. At the beginning of the de- 
bate, Bret Baier asked the candidates in case they do not 
win the Republican nomination if they would pledge not 
to run as an independent candidate and would support the 
eventual nominee. Trump was the only candidate who re- 
fused to pledge at that time. Baier questioned Trump about 
Obamacare, 12851 Chris Wallace asked him about Mexican 
illegal immigrants/ 2861 and Megyn Kelly asked about how 
he would respond to a Clinton campaign saying that he 
was waging a "war on women"/ 2871 Trump replied, “I 
think the big problem this country has is being politically 
correct.” 12881 

In a later interview with Don Lemon on CNN Tonight , 
Trump said that Kelly is a “lightweight” and had “blood 
coming out of her eyes, blood coming out of her... 
wherever.” 128911291 ’ 1 Trump tweeted that his remark referred 
to Kelly’s nose but was interpreted by critics as a refer- 
ence to menstruation. RedState.com editor Erick Erickson 
cancelled Trump’s invitation to a RedState meeting, saying 
“there are just real lines of decency a person running for 
President should not cross.” 12911 The Trump campaign is- 
sued a statement calling Erickson “a total loser” and saying 
that anyone who thought Trump’s comment was a reference 
to menstruation was “a deviant”/ 2921 

Trump retained the first place after the debate, with an 
NBC News poll showing him at 23% support 12931 and a 
Reuters/Ipsos poll at 24%, 12941 followed by Ted Cruz at 
13% and Ben Carson at ll%/ 295! 


Veterans for a Strong America event 

For more details on this topic, see Veterans for a Strong 
America. 

The Veterans for a Strong America (VSA) organized an 
event for Trump on September 15 , 20 1 5. 12961 According to 
the Associated Press, the IRS revoked the nonprofit status 
of the organization, and its endorsement of Trump raised 
campaign finance questions as corporations are restricted 
to donating up to US$2,700 to a campaign, but the event 
exceeded that amount/ 2961 Other concerns raised include 
reports that the VSA does not appear to have any mem- 
bers or relation with veterans/ 2971 According to CNN, the 
group “sounds like a charity”, “touted having more than a 
half-million supporters”, “is a political action group whose 
tax-exempt status was revoked” but is “appealing the deci- 
sion”, and CNN had “found scant evidence” the group has 
the number of supporters claimed/ 2981 Regarding female 
veteran support. Trump has addressed the issue that VA 
hospitals do not permanently staff ObGyn doctors; showing 
an utter lack of respect for female veterans. Trump contin- 
ued on to express that “Under the Trump plan, every VA 
hospital in the country will be fully equipped with ObGyn 
and other women’s health services.” 12991 

Campaign support from family members 

Although Trump has called his wife Melania “my pollster”, 
and has said she strongly supports his presidential run, he 
held back early in the campaign from asking her to actively 
campaign for him, although “she will”, he told CNN in 
September 20 1 5 / 3001 She did appear both at her husband’s 
June 2015 campaign announcement, and in the audience at 
the Fox News debate in Cleveland/ 3001 and in November 
2015 did several televised interviews, and spoke briefly at a 
Trump campaign rally in South Carolina, also attended by 
a number of Trump’s other family members/ 3011 

If Trump were to become President, his wife Melania 
(Slovenian-born, and a naturalized U.S. citizen) would be- 
come only the second U.S. First Lady in history to be born 
outside the United States (after Louisa Adams, wife of John 
Quincy Adams)/ 3021 

False flag conspiracy theory 

A conspiracy theory appearing in the Washington Post, 
Salon, Esquire, Gawker, Talking Points Memo and several 
other political news outlets, and which has been endorsed 
by several of Trump’s opponents, posits that Trump is run- 
ning a "false flag operation” for presumptive Democratic 
nominee Hillary Clinton/ 3031 13041 According to this theory.

CHAPTER 7. POLITICAL CAREER 


ber 2015 found that many of his supporters are working 
class voters with negative feelings towards migrants, as 
well as strong financial concerns. 1329113301 Numerous polls 
show Trump polling significantly favorably among minor- 
ity and woman voters compared to past and present Re- 
publican presidential candidates, citing a September 2015 
SurveyUSA poll. This poll also reports that Trump garners 
some support from voters outside of his party. 1327113311 

Trump’s status as the consistent front-runner for the Re- 
publican nomination led to him being featured on the cover 
of Time magazine in August 2015, with the caption: “Deal 
with it.” 13321 Although some establishment Republicans ex- 
pressed concern by late 2015 about Trump’s perceived neg- 
ative effect, were he to become the Republican nominee, 
on other Republican candidates running for Congressional 
or Gubernatorial positions in 2016, few leading donors 
seemed willing to sponsor a negative campaign against 
him. 13281 “A 'Stop Trump' effort wouldn't work, and it might 
help him”, said Republican Senator Lamar Alexander. 13281 
While the National Republican Senatorial Committee cir- 
culated a confidential memo in September 2015 that did not 
dismiss the possibility of Trump winning the GOP nomina- 
tion, it called him a “misguided missile” with “wacky ideas 
about women”, and noted that he “is subject to farcical fits.” 
The memo urged candidates to carve out platforms broadly 
consonant with Trump’s anti- Washington messaging, and to 
“stake out turf in the same issue zone and offer your own 
ideas”, while not getting “drawn into every Trump state- 
ment and every Trump dust-up.” 13331 Candidates were ad- 
vised in particular not “to re-engage the 'war on women' 
fight” and were told they “shouldn't go near this ground 
other than to say that your wife or daughter is offended by 
what Trump said.” 13331 


Early caucuses and primaries 

Further information: Republican Party presidential pri- 
maries, 2016 

In the lead-up to the Iowa caucus, poll averages showed 
Trump as the front-runner with a roughly four percent 
lead. 13341 Ted Cruz came in first in the vote count, ahead of 
Trump. Cruz, who campaigned strongly among evangelical 
Christians, 13351 was supported by church pastors that coor- 
dinated a volunteer campaign to get out the vote. 13361 Before 
the Iowa vote, an email from the Cruz campaign falsely im- 
plied that Ben Carson was about to quit the race, encour- 
aging Carson’s supporters to vote for Cruz instead. 1337113381 
Trump later posted on Twitter, “Many people voted for 
Cruz over Carson because of this Cruz fraud”, and wrote, 
“Ted Cruz didn't win Iowa, he stole it.” 13391 

Following his under-performance in Iowa, Trump re- 


bounded to a significant victory in the New Hampshire pri- 
mary, exceeding poll predictions. 13401 Trump commented 
that in the run-up to the primary, his campaign had “learned 
a lot about ground games in a week.” 1341 1 This was followed 
by another wide victory in South Carolina, furthering his 
lead among the Republican candidates. 1342113431 He won the 
Nevada caucus on February 24 with a landslide 45.9% of 
the vote, his biggest victory yet; Marco Rubio placed sec- 
ond with 23.9%. [344][34S1 


7.2.6 Campaign finances 

Trump rejected all super PAC’s that claimed to support 
him. He has said: “I am self-funding my campaign and 
therefore I will not be controlled by the donors, special in- 
terests and lobbyists who have corrupted our politics and 
politicians for far too long. 1 have disavowed all super 
PAC’s, requested the return of all donations made to said 
PAC’s, and I am calling on all presidential candidates to do 
the same.” 1161117113461 Politifact reports that Trump’s claims 
that he is “self -funding” his campaign are “half-true.” By 
the end of 2015, Trump’s campaign had raised $19.4 mil- 
lion, with almost $13 million (about 66%) coming from 
Trump himself and the remainder (34%) coming from oth- 
ers’ contributions. 13471 

The announcement came a day after a main super PAC 
backing Trump closed amid scrutiny about its relation- 
ship to the campaign itself. 1348113491 Trump said he never 
gave his endorsement to that super PAC (Make Amer- 
ica Great) or any of the other eight super PAC’s support- 
ing his run. 13501 135 11 Trump told campaign crowds “I don’t 
want anybody’s money”, and criticized other candidates for 
“form[ing] all these PAC’s. People pour money into the 
PAC’s. I don’t want 'em, don’t support 'em.” 13491

7.2.10 Notes 

[1] • Ben Carson, the only African-American candidate 

from either major party in the 2016 race, said that 
Trump's wording was “perhaps a little inflammatory” 
but that this was more a consequence of Trump’s in- 
cendiary style, and that Trump’s core message about 
the problems with illegal immigration was correct. 1771 
Carson also said that the uproar over Trump’s com- 
ments was driven by political correctness, under which 
crimes committed by illegal immigrants was a taboo 
topic. 1781 

• Rick Santorum said he disagreed with Trump’s spe- 
cific comments, but that the economic impact of im- 
migration (both legal as well as illegal) was an impor- 
tant issue. 1721 

[2] • Ted Cruz, a Republican candidate whose father was 

from Cuba, said the need to address illegal immigra- 
tion should no longer be ignored, and although Trump 
had a “bold... brash... colorful way of speaking,” Cruz 
did not intend to attack Trump over his specific phras- 
ing, furthermore suggesting that the “Washington me- 
dia” was interested in encouraging such Republican 
in-fighting. 1791 

• Scott Walker has said he does not wish to “lock 
horns” 1801 with other Republican candidates; when 
asked about Trump’s remarks specifically. Walker 
said other candidates would have to speak for them-

coming... if they want to come and share our flag, our 
interests, our language, assimilate into our culture be- 
cause they believe in what we stand for.” 1831 

[3 J • Jeb Bush, whose wife is from Mexico, said that “we 
should control our borders... [but] these extraordi- 
narily ugly kind of comments [are] not reflective of 
the Republican Party,” 1841 and that such comments are 
meant to inflame and incite. 1851 

• Marco Rubio, the other Republican candidate whose 
parents are from Cuba, said that Trump’s comments 
were “not just offensive and inaccurate, but also 
divisive.” 1791 

• Lindsey Graham said Trump was a “wrecking ball for 
the future of the Republican Party with the Hispanic 
community” 1861 

[4] • Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders said Trump’s 

remarks were “throwing slurs... totally unacceptable... 
an outrage.” 1871 

• Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton said “Basta! 
Enough!... appalling... people and business[es] ev- 
erywhere rejected his hateful comments... shameful” 
and that if elected in 20 1 6, said she would create a path 
to citizenship, preserve Barack Obama's executive or- 
ders related to immigration, and do “everything pos- 
sible under the law to go even further [on immigration 
than Obama]" despite the likelihood of a Republican- 
controlled Senate and House. 1881

selves, and that although Trump may have some ap- 
peal to votes for speaking out boldly, Walker respect- 
fully disagreed with Trump’s stances, and said he sup- 
ports securing the border and enforcing existing laws 
(but that he no longer supports amnesty and that a path 
to citizenship should have a “high bar”). 1811 

• Rand Paul also said he tries to stick to laying out his 
own immigration plan, rather than commenting on 
other candidates, but that “most people come to this 
country in the search of the American dream... doesn't 
mean you can have a lawless border though... we do 
need to have security at our border.” 1821 

• Mike Huckabee says he focuses on putting forward his 
own views on immigration, but that he “say[s] some 
things very differently... thank God I’m in a coun- 
try people are trying to break into, rather than one 
they’re trying to break out of... [immigrants are] some 
of the most conservative, family-oriented and faith- 
based people... I would never besmirch all the people 
who come here because [of]... how many people are

“Pessimism of white evangelical Americans is boon for Don- 
ald Trump”. Christian Today. December 4, 2015. Half of 
all Americans now believe the country’s best days are be- 
hind it, and this belief is particularly strong among white, 
evangelical Christians. This is one of the beliefs that Repub- 
lican frontrunner Trump is capitalising on in his campaign 
and helps explain why he is doing so well. The pessimism 
about the state of the country is reflected in raised levels of 
concern about crime, racial tensions and immigration, the 
survey reports.

7.3 Tour DuPont 

The Tour DuPont was a cycling stage race in the United 
States held between 1991 and 1996. It was intended to 
become a North American cycling event similar in format 
and prestige to the Tour de France. The tour’s name came 
from its sponsor, DuPont. The race was held in the Mid- 
Atlantic States, including areas near DuPont’s Wilmington, 
Delaware headquarters. 

The event attracted high-level competitors, including Lance 
Armstrong and Greg LeMond, and was attended by high 
profile European based cycling teams. After the sixth run- 
ning in 1996, however, DuPont dropped its sponsorship and 
the race has not been run since. 

Before the creation of the Tour DuPont, a similar race spon- 
sored by Donald Trump and known as the Tour de Trump 
was run in 1989 and 1990. 

7.3.1 Results and notable moments 

The initial race, in 1991, witnessed an exciting finish, as 
the Netherlands’ Erik Breukink of team PDM came from 
50 seconds behind despite a flat tire to defeat Atle Kvalsvoll 
on the streets of Wilmington, Delaware. That year also saw 
the first occasion in which an American held the overall 
lead in the nation’s premier race, when Greg Oravetz of the 
Coors Light team took the yellow jersey on a breakaway in 
Arlington, Virginia. Covered on national television, with 
video still available, it was the last year that Lance Arm- 
strong raced as an amateur, teamed with other young Amer- 
icans wearing a Skittles - U.S. National Team jersey, with 
American Nate Schafer winning the Stage 5 Criterium two 
places ahead of his teammate Lance. 

In 1992, the first American winner of the tour in Tour de 
France champion Greg LeMond; his teammate Kvalsvoll 
finished second for the second year running, supporting 
LeMond over the final three days even though only one sec- 
ond separated the two riders. 

1993’s tour witnessed the first stirrings of a future cycling 
star, as Lance Armstrong, riding for team Motorola, chal- 
lenged team WordPerfect's Raul Alcala for the victory; Al- 
cala triumphed after outperforming Armstrong in a 36-mile 
(59 km) time trial, but the young American finished second. 


Another WordPerfect rider, Viatcheslav Ekimov, captured 
the overall victory in 1994, with Armstrong placing sec- 
ond for a second year running. The American finally broke 
through to the winner’s spot on the podium until 1995, 
outcompeting Ekimov and Andrea Peron. Armstrong also 
won the final tour in 1996; France’s Pascal Herve finished 
second. 11 *

Bibliography 


8.1 "Trump: The Art of the Deal" 

“The Art of the Deal” redirects here. For the Prison Break 
television series episode, see Prison Break (season 3). For 
the 2016 parody film, see Donald Trump’s The Art of the 
Deal: The Movie. 

Trump: The Art of the Deal is a 1987 book by business 
magnate Donald Trump and journalist Tony Schwartz. Part 
memoir and part a business advice book, it reached #1 on 
the New York Times Bestseller list and held a position in the 
list for 51 weeks. 1 11 

It was the first book by Donald Trump. 121 Trump was per- 
suaded to write the book by Conde Nast owner Si New- 
house after the May 1984 issue of the Newhouse magazine 
GQ, with Trump appearing on the cover, sold well. 1 1 131 The 
book was co-written by journalist Tony Schwartz and pub- 
lished on November 1, 1987 by Warner Books. 

The book was published three years before Trump’s finan- 
cial decline in 1991. 141 Trump’s self-promotion, best-selling 
book and media celebrity status led one commentator to call 
him “a poster-child for the 'Greed is Good' 1980s”. The 
phrase “Greed is Good” was from the movie Wall Street 
which was released a month after The Art of the Deal. 


8.1.1 Synopsis 

In the book. Trump writes about his childhood, his work 
in Brooklyn prior to moving to Manhattan and building 
The Trump Organization out of his studio apartment, de- 
veloping the Hyatt Hotels and Trump Tower, renovating 
Wollman Rink, and other projects. 161 

The book also contains an 1 1 -step formula for business suc- 
cess inspired by Norman Vincent Peale's The Power of Pos- 
itive Thinking The steps include #1 “Think Big”, #7 “Get 
the Word Out”, #10 “Contain the Costs”. 1 1 1 


8.1.2 Copies sold 

The number of copies sold has been the subject of specu- 
lation in a number of sources. Trump asserted in his 2016 
Presidential run that Art of the Deal is “the No. 1 selling 
business book of all time.” 171 Some sources report it sold 
over 1 million copies . 1 1 ! In a more detailed analysis by Linda 
Qiu in the Tampa Bay Times, other business books were 
found to have sold many more copies than Art of the Deal . 1 8 1 
Qiu noted it was impossible to find exact sales figures, but 
gave a range of possibilities based on known claims and 
facts. Compared to six other famous business books. Art of 
the Deal ranked in 5th place according to their analysis. [8]

8.2 "Crippled America" 


Crippled America : How to Make America Great Again 
is a book by Donald Trump, published in 2015. [1] It was 
released November 3 with Trump holding a signing session 
of it in the Trump Tower. All proceeds from the book will 
go to charities. 121 


8.2.1 Contents 

In the book. Trump clarifies his position on illegal immi- 
grants, claiming that the vast majority have come to im- 
prove their futures and the futures of their children. He 
also writes that despite his past affiliation to the Demo- 
cratic Party, he has always held Conservative values. Trump 
informs the reader that despite his previous support for 
single-payer health care, a position held mostly by liberals 
in America, he has changed his position because “It works 
incredibly well in Scotland, for example, and maybe it could 
have worked here at a different time. But not anymore.” 111 

Trump writes that he had opposed the Iraq War, seeing it 
as a potential destabilising force, and sees military interven- 
tion as a last resort because “I've seen their broken bodies, 
know all about the horrors that live in their heads, and the 
enormous effects of trauma.” On the subject of the $1 mil- 
lion loan given to him by his father to start his fortune, he 
states that a similar loan would likely have been given by a 
bank. Elsewhere, Trump reflects that his focus on his work 
was the cause of his two divorces. 111 

Trump admits that he makes hyperbolic statements because 
“if you're not afraid to be outspoken, the media will write 
about you or beg you to come on their shows.” He justifies 
this strategy by saying that he is a businessman and “When 
was the last time you saw a sign hanging outside a pizzeria 
claiming 'The fourth best pizza in the world'?!" 111
