Someone as detached from reality as Donald Trump should never be in charge of making decisions that are as real as they come.
Donald Trump is temperamentally unfit to be president of the United States.
Look at the policies Trump has proposed they would put prejudice into practice.
Trump would form an armed deportation force to round up millions of immigrants and kick them out of the country.
Trump would abolish this bedrock constitutional principle: if youre born in the U.S., youre an American citizen.
Trump would ban every Muslim around the world1.5 billion men, women, and childrenfrom entering the U.S. just because of their religion.
Trump likes to say he only hires the "best people," but hes had to fire so many campaign managers its like an episode of the Apprentice.
Trump hired the head of Breitbart "News" to be CEO of his campaign. Here's a sample of their work:
A fringe element has effectively taken over Trumps campaign and the Republican Party.
Theres an old Mexican proverb that says Tell me with whom you walk, and I will tell you who you are.We know who Trump is.
20 years ago, when Bob Dole accepted the Republican nomination, he pointed to the exits and told any racists in the Party to get out.
Our rising generation of young Americans is the most open, diverse, and connected weve ever seen.

Trump says he wants to "make America great again," but his real message remains make America hate again.
Trump asked what the African American community has to lose by voting for him. @MarlonDMarshall's response:
It's not a coincidence that white supremacists proudly support Trump.
Trump's bigoted rhetoric and policy proposals aren't a dog whistle. We hear him loud and clear.
Donald Trumps campaign of prejudice and paranoia is unlike anything weve seenand its profoundly dangerous.
Republican leaders should take a look at who they're standing with.
Countless women fought to win the right to vote. On the anniversary of the 19th Amendment's adoption, let's recommit to protecting it. -H
We've made our union more perfect because people refused to be kept on the sidelines. Onward. #WomensEqualityDay
On this day in 1920, the 19th Amendment was adopted and many women won the right to vote. Let's break more ceilings.
Yes, @realDonaldTrump really did say all of these hateful things.
So what has the @ClintonFdn been up to? Helping millions of people get more affordable medicine to treat HIV/AIDS.
Happy #WomensEqualityDay from @realDonaldTrump.
Daughter, business owner, and immigrant: Meet Luisachaser of the American Dream.
Making it easier to live the American Dream means making it easier to start and grow a small business.

We're stronger togetherand the diversity of our athletes in Rio proved it.
"The right to vote is still the most powerful nonviolent tool of transformation we have." @RepJohnLewis
Trump's housing company would mark black renters' applications with a "C" for "colored"then reject them.
We have some questions about this letter from Donald Trump's doctor.
Dear Donald: You can't make America great again when you don't make things in America.
Charity Watch called the @ClintonFdn "one of the great humanitarian charities of our generation."
Trump talks about enacting extreme policy ideas that hurt Americans. His VP pick has actually done it.
Too many Americans living with mental illness have been left to face it on their own.
Qumber's parents came to this country for the American Dream. Trump is a threat to all they've achieved:
Donald Trump: Make ________BangladeshChinaIndiaIndonesiaVietnamMexicoSloveniaGreat Again?
The choice in November: a president with real plans to combat climate changeor one who calls it a hoax.
It's time to finally put access to care for mental health on par with physical health.
Big victory from the @NLRB for workers' right to organize for fair wages and benefits.
Give the Trump family a huge tax cut or take care of our veterans? Not a hard choice.

Eight reasons why you shouldn't need a four-year degree to have a successful career:
60% of adults experiencing mental health illnesses are untreated. It's time to close the treatment gap.
Trump's plan:1. Round up and deport every single undocumented immigrant2. Build a concrete wallAn alternative:
Trump loves his "Make America Great Again" hat a lot for a guy who outsourced jobs to 12 different countries.
What you need to know about the "alt-right" and @realDonaldTrump's connections to white supremacy and hate groups:
"From the first days of his campaign, Donald Trump has painted Mexicans as 'rapists' and criminals."
A big, beautiful list of literally every tweet Donald Trump has sent about Mexico over the last two years.
RT this if you agree.
We're still 2.5 million away from reaching our August fundraising goal. Chip in by midnight and get a free sticker:
.@GovChristie, vetoing a minimum wage increase is a blow to working families. No one who works full-time should have to live in poverty. -H
No matter how great the challenge, America must lead. Hillary to the @AmericanLegion
"They have to go."Trump has been perfectly clear about his intentions for millions of immigrants.
As Trump meets with President Pea Nieto, a helpful refresher on some of the things hes said about Mexico:
"We are building a wall. He's a Mexican! Donald Trump, June 3, 2016
Trump has vilified Mexicans and immigrants since day one of his campaign. That's not what America stands for.
Great news for North Carolinians. Let's make voting easier so every voice in our democracy can be heard. -H
I will never lie to you. Donald Trump, August 18, 2016
"It turns out Trump didn't just choke, he got beat in the room and lied about it." @JohnPodesta
A wall that Mexico will pay for: a bad idea from an even worse negotiator.
Trump just failed his first foreign test. Diplomacy isn't as easy as it looks. -H

Donald Trump could actually be our next president. Chip in before midnight to make sure that never happens:
Trump's extreme immigration speech got rave reviewsfrom white supremacists, the alt-right, and Ann Coulter.

"Hes causing nations to wonder if well actually keep our word. @JoeBiden on Donald Trump:
"Trump, the self-proclaimed tough negotiator, not only choked but openly lied about choking."
This choice couldn't be starker.
"There will be no softening whatsoever." the @WashingtonPost on Trump's most alarming immigration speech yet
Born Sept. 1, 1933, former TX Gov. Ann Richards opened doors for women and minorities in her own state and beyond.
If Trump needs help with diplomacy, he could learn a lot from our last secretary of state.
It took Donald Trump exactly one foreign policy trip to get rebuked by a leader of an ally nation.
Turns out, hosting Miss Universe pageants abroad doesn't equate to diplomatic skills.
So, how did Donald Trump's first swing at diplomacy go? Not so great.Try to follow his decision-making process:
The disastrous Mexico wall trip: a case study in the Trump school of diplomacy.
As a candidate, Trump has already embarrassed us on the world stage.Imagine the damage he'd do as president.
The worst part is, Trump's disturbing policies for immigrant families go way beyond just "building a wall."
Trump and his hateful language are affecting our kids. These are some of the heartbreaking things they're saying:
Drug companies should never put profits before patients. Our plan to stop excessive prescription drug price hikes:
When Ruline was born in 1913, women couldn't vote.In 2016, she'll cast her vote to elect the 1st woman president.
America needs leadership in the White House, not a liability.
Donald Trump's plan on immigration has been clear all along: demonize immigrants, "build a wall," deport millions.
Donald Trump's pattern of prejudice and discrimination started long before he was a presidential candidate.
Our planet's future depends on the decisions we make now.RT if you agree it's time to combat climate change.
A reminder as America officially joins the Paris climate agreement.We cant stop there:
Even before his hateful speech this week, Trump has never been vague about his feelings toward immigrants.
Thanks, @POTUS, for reaffirming the law to protect women's healthwhichever provider you choose.
"Thats a special thing about Hillarywhen theres a job worth doing, she doesnt abandon it." President Carter
We have a new @Tumblr! Check out letters to Hillary from Americans around the country at
Astonishing that the Republican nominee still refuses to acknowledge that @POTUS was born in the United States.
There's going to be no one left in Washington for Trump to work with who he hasnt insulted.
If you're a fan of weekends, thank a union member.
Unions stand up for workers who need someone to have their backs. We need a president who will do the same.
Unions gave us higher wages, weekends, and the largest middle class in the world. That's worth celebrating and protecting. Happy #LaborDay! -H
One candidate would stand up for workers and their families. The other? Not so much.
Sec. of Labor Frances Perkins was our first woman cabinet member and an architect of the Fair Labor Standards Act.
"Human rights are women's rights, and women's rights are human rights." Hillary in Beijing, 21 years ago today

"I know more about ISIS than the generals do." Donald TrumpNo, you don't.
World leaders on why Hillary's tenure as secretary of state prepared her to be president:
The @DallasNews hasn't endorsed a Democrat for president since before WWII. Here's why it's endorsing Hillary:
When our SEALs took out bin Laden, they brought the terrorists' families to safety first. That's American honor.
Donald Trump doesn't "know why" African Americans would be offended that he pushed the "birther" conspiracy:
We can't afford a president who would sabotage our efforts to fight climate change.
.@POTUS, @madeleine, and Leon Panetta agree: Hillary's one of the best secretaries of state we've had.
Did Trump use his charitable foundation to prevent a state attorney general from investigating his fraud?
The U.S. presidency isn't an entry-level job.How Hillary's time as our secretary of state shows she's ready:
A man who talks about our veterans and military families like this doesn't deserve to be Commander-in-Chief.
A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons.
Tonight, Americans will hear what Trump would do as Commander-in-Chief.Here are 5 reasons he's unfit for the job:
Donald Trump has proven over and over again that he's unfit to be our Commander-in-Chief.
It takes experience, toughness, and a steady temperament to be our Commander-in-Chief. #NBCNewsForum
Our next Commander-in-Chief needs to have the steadiness, strength, and judgment to make life and death decisions.
Hillary has spent decades fighting for veterans, members of the military, and their families.  #NBCNewsForum
"I will not let the VA be privatized." Hillary  #NBCNewsForum
We need to do everything we can to remove barriers to the health care our veterans needwhether physical or mental. #NBCNewsForum

The next time Donald Trump throws a temper tantrum, imagine if he had the nuclear codes.
Last night, Trump chose to talk about his deep admiration and support for Putin.Maybe he did it with a smile.

"Everyone here...has stumbled on their own stony roads. Its grace that lifts us up, grace that leads us home. Hillary to the @nbcusa_inc
We need a president who understands that none of us has all the answers and no one person can fix our problems alone.
We need a president who will do justice, love kindness, and walk humbly.
Unlike Trump's, this plan to defeat ISIS isnt a secret.
The most important quality in a president and Commander-in-Chief is steadinessan absolute, rock solid steadiness.
The next time Trump throws a tantrum, picture him in the Situation Room making life-or-death decisions for us.
Making the wrong choice on climate change would be a disaster for our kids and grandkids.

When 40 million Americans are facing the same problem, it's a crisis. One candidate has a plan to address it.
Proud of you, @Simone_Biles. We can all learn from your courage in standing up to stigma.
